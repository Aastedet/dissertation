# Perspectives and future research

## Perspectives

The findings call for bla bla bla updated guidelines, increased awareness....

Action card for physicians: which areas of care to pay particular attention in each migrant group, when delivering care to a migrant with T2D.

## Future research

Validated diabetes classifiers, or similar, should be used. Validation studies on diabetes duration/age at onset of diabetes should be performed.

Qualitative studies? The reasons for the observed disparities should be studied, and intervention studies are needed to address these reasons in migrants in an evidence-based way.

Other vulnerable groups?


Discerning T1D from T2D using insulin vs. non-insulin GLD purchases is likely to become a greater challenge in the future, as SGLT2i and GLP1RA may establish themselves as treatment options in T1D due to their effects on cardiovascular and kidney risk.
With novel GLD types becoming indicated in heart and kidney patients without diabetes, inclusion criteria in register-based algorithms will have to adapt accordingly.
