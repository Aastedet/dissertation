# Introduction

This chapter describes diabetes mellitus and the clinical guidelines for care, introduces the reader to identification of diabetes patients in Danish healthcare registers, and provides an outline of T2D in migrants.

*This paragraph should introduce the overall context, and very briefly introduce the aims/niche of the project*

## Diabetes

Diabetes mellitus is a metabolic disorder defined by elevated levels of blood-glucose (hyperglycemia) that is classified into several types with distinct clinical . These include *type 1 diabetes* (T1D), *type 2 diabetes* (T2D), *gestational diabetes mellitus* (GDM), as well as other types.[@ADA2022] T2D constitutes the vast majority of all cases and is characterized by inadequate $\beta$-cell insulin secretion due to insulin resistance, while T1D is characterized by insulin deficiency due to autoimmune $\beta$-cell destruction. T2D prevalence exceeds half a billion individuals worldwide and is increasing, particularly in developing countries, due to factors such as ageing of populations, urbanization, increased energy-dense diets and sedentary lifestyles. [@diabetesatlas] While T1D and T2D both carry the risk of developing diabetic complications that lead to morbidity and mortality, they are distinct clinical entities, and T1D is typically treated in the hospital outpatient sector, while T2D care is often provided by *general practitioners* (GPs) and other actors in the primary care sector.

Complications are traditionally divided into macrovascular (e.g. *cardiovascular disease* (CVD)) and microvascular complications (e.g. kidney disease, retinopathy, neuropathy), but additional complications exist. Several lifestyle and physiological factors influence the risk of developing complications, and clinical care revolves around management of these. In addition to being key risk factors of complications, blood pressure, *hemoglobin-A1C* (HbA1c), and *low-density lipoprotein cholesterol* (LDL-C) are parameters that drive treatment indications and clinical decision-making. *\[mangler ref\]*

Due to their effects on HbA1c, LDL-C, and blood pressure, *glucose-lowering drugs* (GLD), *lipid-lowering drugs* (LLD), and antihypertensive drugs are critical parts of T2D care. In T2D patients with particularly high risk of complications, pharmacological treatment also includes *antiplatelet therapy* (APT), as the complication risk-lowering effect outweighs the risk of adverse events in these patients.[@haller2011arb; @zoungas2011advance]

In addition to their effect on biomarker levels, certain drug types within the above classes of drugs have other positive effects. In particular, the GLD types *sodium glucose co-transporter type 2 inhibitors* (SGLT2i) and *glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists* (GLP1RA) substantially reduce the risk of adverse cardiovascular and renal events beyond their effect on HbA1c. Similarly, the antihypertensive drugs types *angiotensin-converting enzyme-inhibitors* (ACEI) and *angiotensin receptor blockers* (ARB) reduce the risk and improve the prognosis of *diabetic kidney disease* (DKD) beyond their effect on blood pressure. *\[mangler ref\]*

Combination therapy - the use of multiple drug types with differing mechanisms of action - is a way to increase treatment intensity and achieve treatment goals with fewer side-effects. Combination therapy is particularly important in T2D, as GLD monotherapy fails to achieve target levels of HbA1c in many patients, even at maximal dosage. *\[mangler ref\]*

Timely monitoring of risk factors and complications allows for prompt adjustment of treatment, and monitoring has previously been used as a process indicator of care quality, although the direct evidence on its influence on outcomes is sparse. *\[see refs*

## Clinical guidelines for type 2 diabetes care

The Danish College of General Practitioners publishes national clinical guidelines for T2D in cooperation with the Danish Endocrine Society. The guidelines are continuously updated as new evidence emerges. In this PhD project, T2D care was studied in the time period covered by the 2012[@dsam2012] and 2019[@dsam2019] revisions (only minor changes were made between the two revisions). These guidelines advise that monitoring intervals, biomarker goals and treatment intensity is adapted to fit the individual patient, but specify recommendations that may be used as indicators of care quality. Guideline recommendations relevant to this PhD study are described below.

### Diagnosis

HbA1c values $\ge48 mmol/mol$ are diagnostic of diabetes, but diagnosis must be confirmed with a repeated sample on a different day. Once diagnosed, patients with T2D should be considered permanently affected by the disease, and the associated risk factors for complications should be treated regardless of subsequent normalization of HbA1c.

### Monitoring

The risk biomarkers HbA1c and LDL-C should be measured yearly, as well as urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR) to screen for DKD. Repeated samples of UACR $\ge 300mg/g$ is considering diagnostic of diabetic kidney disease (DKD). Diabetic retinopathy should be screened by an ophthalmologist every second year and screening for diabetic foot disease by a podiatrist every year. At the initial diagnosis of T2D, a baseline-screening of all five types of monitoring is recommended.

### Biomarker levels

#### Hemoglobin-A1c

The goal should be the lowest possible HbA1c without hypoglycemia or inappropriate polypharmacy. Specific targets at $48 mmol/mol$, $53 mmol/mol$, $58 mmol/mol$, and $70 mmol/mol$ are provided depending on diabetes duration and severity, complications, age and comorbidities.

#### Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol

As low as possible, but at least below 2.6 mmol/L, and below 1.8 in individuals with complications.

### Pharmacological treatment

#### Glucose-lowering drugs

**Combination therapy:** GLD therapy is recommended in patients with HbA1c ≥ 48 mmol/mol, and metformin is the recommended first-line treatment. There is no overall recommendation of second- or third-line drugs, although SGLT2i or GLP1RA should be considered in patients with CVD when metformin or other treatment is insufficient to reach the patient's HbA1c target. Note that - although not in effect during the time under study - the recommendation for SGLT2i and GLP1RA was expanded in the 2022 revision to include all T2D patients with CVD, multiple risk factors for CVD, or chronic kidney disease, irrespective of HbA1c level.

**Individual drug types**

Without a clear hierarchy between GLD drug types, guidelines recommend factoring in all effects - positive and negative - and cost when choosing between the individual drug types. *Summarise guideline considerations on second- and third-line drugs, similar to* https://vejledninger.dsam.dk/media/238.png

#### Lipid-lowering drugs

Individuals with prevalent CVD, diabetic nephropathy, or LDL-C above 2.5 mmol/L should receive LLD treatment

#### **Antihypertensive drugs**

In addition to their indication in the treatment of hypertension, ACEI or ARB is recommended in individuals with prevalent CVD, microalbuminuria, or diabetic kidney disease.

#### Antiplatelet therapy

APT is recommended in individuals with prevalent CVD, diabetic kidney disease or very high risk of CVD due to other risk factors. This recommendation was expanded in the 2022 revision to also include individuals with kidney failure and concurrent microalbuminuria.

## Migrants and type 2 diabetes

### Migrant origin

While migrant origin in research is often a simple variable used to capture socioeconomic position, it reflects both genetic disposition, cultural ethnicity, and potential language barriers, mental and physical trauma. *\[mangler ref\]*

Historically, particularly in Europe and the United States, migrants have been defined by their racial appearance, and ethnic minority groups categorized accordingly. In research, these categories obscure the role of migrants in the modern era, [@erayil2021raceethnicity]. *\[something about how the sparse evidence on T2D in ethnic minorities is often based on race, which doesn't capture ethnicity in the modern era of global migration very well, and very little direct evidence is available on T2D in migrants\]*.

Research on migrant groups faces several challenges that may explain the lack of direct evidence on T2D care in these groups. Compared to the native populations, migrants are a minority comprised of younger individuals, which limits the size of migrant T2D study populations available to researchers. In addition, migrants are often a hard-to-reach group in studies that require patient engagement for inclusion, which exacerbates sample size problems and induces selection bias in such study designs.

### Type 2 diabetes, complications and mortality

In European countries, migrant origin is a well-established risk factor for T2D, with prevalence several times higher than that of the native populations *\[mangler ref\]*. The evidence on complication risk in migrants with T2D also indicates a higher risk of CVD compared to native populations, but not as consistent, as complication risk differs between complication types, migrant groups and countries. Similarly, higher mortality among migrants with T2D has been reported in some studies *\[refs\]*, while other studies have found similar or lower risk *\[refs - se https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8563673/\]*.

### Monitoring

Evidence between countries and different aspects of monitoring is conflicting: Some times more monitoring is reported, other times less. *\[mangler ref\]*

### Biomarker levels

#### Hemoglobin-A1c

Higher than in native populations. Is likely to contribute to a higher complication risk and mortality.

#### Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol

Pretty much unknown.

### Pharmacological treatment

#### Glucose-lowering drugs

GLD treatment is prescribed earlier and to a larger proportion of migrants than to the native populations, but disparities in the use of combination therapy or each type of GLD has not been studied. *\[something about indirect evidence: racial groups and socioeconomic disparities, and the Italian study\]*

#### Lipid-lowering drugs

Studies from European countries have reported lower rates of prescribing of LLD in migrants with T2D *\[care_qual_migrants refs 40, 5\]* also when accounting for differences in treatment indications *\[Eastwood\].*

#### Antihypertensive drugs and antiplatelet therapy

Few studies have reported on ACEI/ARB and APT in migrants, but a study from Italy found lower odds of treatment in most migrant groups \[42\].

### Guideline-recommendations on migrants (or the lack thereof)

Despite the special challenges outlined above, migrants are not addressed in the Danish national clinical guidelines' appendix on pharmacological treatment of special groups. The few recommendations regarding migrants are limited to increased screening for diabetes and tailored patient education programs.

## Identification of type 2 diabetes cases in healthcare registers

### Benefits

Healthcare registers provide a powerful data source for population-wide studies without the need to engage the patient for inclusion. The ability to include all individuals in the population makes them particularly suited for studies of migrants with T2D, where sample size is a limiting factor and other data sources are vulnerable to selection bias in these groups.

### Challenges

*\[CP/Similar to validation study intro, rephrase and add refs\]*
General-purpose registers and other administrative databases often provide the basis of
diabetes epidemiology, but rarely contain validated diabetes-specific data. If
the diabetes-specific data is not accurate, bias may be induced into studies. Thus, it is important to have an accurate tool to identify individuals with diabetes in the registers, as findings may differ with various diabetes definitions.^1,2^ Considerable efforts have been made towards establishing such a tool for diabetes research in several countries, including Denmark.^3-6^

Databases requiring reporting from GPs... low reporting in T2D from primary sector: DVDD

Some algorithms to classify T1D and T2D have been validated in cohorts of individuals with diabetes, but none have been validated in a general population, which leaves population-wide register-based studies vulnerable to biases.

Validation study recommended HbA1c inclusion

### Register-based diabetes classifiers

In Denmark, the Register of Selected Chronic Diseases (RSCD) is currently the only publicly available resource to identify diabetes cases in Danish register data (by application to the Danish Health Data Authority), but it has not been
publicly validated nor is the source code behind the algorithm publicly
available. Notably, the algorithm lacks inclusion based on elevated HbA1c
levels.

## Introduction at a glance

*\[Summarises introduction in a format that naturally leads to the aims of the study (the next chapter)\]*

T2D is a disease that carries serious risks, but several treatment options are available to control the risk factors in T2D and reduce the risk of complications and death, and guidelines are available to direct clinicians and patients towards the best possible outcomes. Migrants are particularly vulnerable to T2D, having increased prevalence and - possibly - higher complication risk and mortality than native European populations. Despite this, there is very limited knowledge on specific areas of care that may contribute to an excess risk in migrants with T2D.

Research on migrant groups faces several challenges that may explain the lack of evidence. The sample size is limited, since migrants are a minority group and often hard-to-reach for intervention and survey studies. Register-based studies are well-suited to handle these limitations, as they are able to include the whole population, but registers rarely contain validated diabetes-specific data. Currently, there is no validated method to identify T2D cases in a general population, which leaves register-based studies in this area vulnerable to biases.
