## Setting

### The Danish healthcare system

*\[Describe the danish public healthcare system: sectors, actors, reimbursement and patient-incurred costs.\]*

Denmark is divided into 5 administrative regions that are responsible for providing public healthcare services to their residents through public hospitals and contract agreements with private actors in the primary care sector. Private actors include GPs and other specialist practices (e.g. ophthalmologists), as well as other healthcare professionals (e.g. podiatrists). In addition, the 98 Danish municipalities are obliged to offer resources to prevent and/or manage chronic disease, such as programs on managing T2D through diet and physical exercise.

Although referral to outpatient hospital care is possible, patients with T2D are primarily treated at the GP, which native Danes and migrants with residence permit have free access to. In the tax-funded Danish public healthcare system, Danish citizens and migrants with residence permit have equal access to services, and nearly all services are provided free of charge, although T2D patients incur some out-of-pocket co-payments for podiatrist care and prescription drug purchases at pharmacies. Yearly co-payments towards medication expenditures are partially covered from €132 and expenditures beyond €553 are fully covered (2019 limits),[@reimbursement] while 50% of all expenditures towards diabetes-specific podiatrist care are covered by the the public health insurance.[@okportal]

## Data sources

*\[Describe the overall CPR number system and acquisition and how it related to civil registration, healthcare contacts and prescription drug use, and how it allows linkage of the data sources.\]*

The Danish registers contain

Data for this study was gathered from several sources and linked on an

individual level using the unique personal identifier given to all Danish residents at immigration or birth. Civil registration, all healthcare contacts and drug prescriptions in Denmark are recorded with this identifier, thus enabling complete data linkage and coverage of the entire population.

### The Danish National Patient Register

NPR ref Validation refs e.g. for CVD goes in discussion chapter 5.

### The Danish Register of Laboratory Results for Research

RLRR ref? RLRR covers all of Denmark...

### The Clinical Laboratory Information System of Central Denmark Region

At the time of data acquisition, RLRR did not yet cover the Central Denmark Region, and laboratory results from this part of the the population was extracted from the CLIS/LABKA ref

## Diabetes classification algorithms

*\[A short intro on why we decided to develop a novel algorithm to classify diabetes instead of just validating the existing classifier\].* Introduce OSDC and RSCD abbreviations

As a point of reference in validation, we developed an implementation of the algorithms of the RSCD diabetes classifier (version 1.0, August 2016) according to official documentation.^27^

The following sections describe the algorithms behind each diabetes classifier.

*\[detailed discussion of choices in OSDC, e.g. on obstetric coding, and pros/cons of RSCD goes in chapter 5\]*

## Validation Questionnaire data

### The Health In Central Denmark survey

Describe population, inclusion, responses etc. HICD ref

### The National Health Survey

Describe population, inclusion, responses etc. NHS ref. This survey was only used for supplementary validation analyses.

## Study design and population

Study I was designed to examine the validity of register-based definitions of T1D and T2D, the latter of which was used to identify the population-wide study populations in studies II and III.

*\[Overview table of the three studies\]*

### Study populations

#### Study I

From nationwide healthcare registers, data covering the Central Denmark Region was used to identify diabetes populations using the OSDC and RSCD classifiers.

#### Study II

*\[Describe the different study populations in the analyses of study II, "indication for treatment", and the reason for exclusions\]*

#### Study III

*\[Describe the study populations in study III\]*

### Outcomes

#### Study I

The validation outcomes

#### Study II

Prevalence and the indicators of care quality

#### Study III

*Combinations therapy and individual drug types*

#### Timeline of all outcomes across the three studies

Make a figure.

### Primary variable of interest: migrant status

*\[CP from papers\]*

### Other explanatory variables

*\[CP from papers\]*

## Statistical analysis

#### Study I

Validation: Introduce sensitivity, PPV and other validation metrics.

#### Study II & III

Robust poisson regression. Why we chose the models that we did.
