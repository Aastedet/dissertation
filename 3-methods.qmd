## Setting

### The Danish healthcare system

*\[Describe the danish public healthcare system: sectors, actors, reimbursement and patient-incurred costs.\]*

Denmark is divided into 5 administrative regions that are responsible for providing public healthcare services to their residents through public hospitals and contract agreements with private actors in the primary care sector. Private actors include GPs and other specialist practices (e.g. ophthalmologists), as well as other healthcare professionals (e.g. podiatrists). In addition, the 98 Danish municipalities are obliged to offer resources to prevent and/or manage chronic disease, such as programs on managing T2D through diet and physical exercise.

Although referral to outpatient hospital care is possible, patients with T2D are primarily treated at the GP, which native Danes and migrants with residence permit have free access to. In the tax-funded Danish public healthcare system, Danish citizens and migrants with residence permit have equal access to services, and nearly all services are provided free of charge, although T2D patients incur some out-of-pocket co-payments for podiatrist care and prescription drug purchases at pharmacies. Yearly co-payments towards medication expenditures are partially covered from €132 and expenditures beyond €553 are fully covered (2019 limits),[@reimbursement] while 50% of all expenditures towards diabetes-specific podiatrist care are covered by the the public health insurance.[@okportal]

## Data sources

*\[Describe the overall CPR number system and acquisition and how it related to civil registration, healthcare contacts and prescription drug use, and how it allows linkage of the data sources.\]*

In Denmark, civil registration, public healthcare contacts, and drug prescriptions are recorded with a unique personal identifier (the *CPR number*) given to all Danish residents at immigration or birth. This enables coverage of the entire population and complete linkage between data sources, and forms the foundation of several nationwide Danish healthcare registers.[@regsoverview] The following section briefly describes the data extracted from these registers, as well as other data sources used in the PhD project.

### The Danish Civil Registration System

The Danish Civil Registration System contains civil registration data on all residents in Denmark. Information on migrations and country of origin was extracted, in addition to data on age, sex, equivalised disposable household income,[@eurostat_equiv] employment status, and region of residence.

### The Danish National Patient Register

The Danish National Patient Register contains information on all hospital admissions and outpatient contacts. Data on diagnoses of diabetes and cardiovascular complications, and procedures relating to retinal screening and treatment of cardiovascular complications was extracted from 1994 through 2018. At the time of this PhD project, the clinical coding system in use was the International Classification of Diseases, $10th$ revision (*ICD-10*), implemented in 1994.[@icd10]

### The Danish National Health Service Register

The Danish National Health Service Register contains information on all public healthcare services provided in the primary care sector. The data is essentially billing information, and serves as the basis for payment to the healthcare provider from the Danish regions. Each type of service has a unique *SPECIALE*-code (e.g. all diabetes-specific podiatrist care services are contained as sub-codes under *SPECIALE*-code 54) Information on diabetes-specific services performed at podiatrist and ophthalmologist practices from 1990 through 2018 was extracted, as well as point-of-care HbA1c testing performed at GPs.

### The Danish National Prescription Registry

The Danish National Prescription Registry contains information on all prescription drug purchases at Danish pharmacies, classified according to the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) Classification. These registrations serve to determine reimbursement awarded to each purchase from the public health insurance. Information on purchases of GLD, LLD, ACEI, ARB, and APT from 1995 through 2018 was extracted.

### The Danish Register of Laboratory Results for Research

The Danish Register of Laboratory Results for Research contains information on clinical biomarker samples analysed at clinical biochemistry departments in hospitals around Denmark. With the exception of point-of-care tests, all biomarker samples taken in the primary healthcare sector are sent for analysis in hospital laboratories. Compared to the other registers, this is a relatively new register, initially launched in 2013, and only recently achieved nationwide coverage.[@rlrr]

At the time of data extraction, the Central Denmark Region was not yet covered in the register, and laboratory results from this part of the the population were extracted directly from the *Clinical Laboratory Information System*, a clinical database that stores all laboratory results analysed in Central Denmark Region. Data on HbA1c, LDL-C, and UACR analyses were extracted from 2011 through 2018.

## Diabetes classification algorithms

*\[A short intro on why we decided to develop a novel algorithm to classify diabetes instead of just validating the existing classifier\].* Introduce OSDC and RSCD abbreviations

As described above, nationwide laboratory data on HbA1c testing has become available in the Danish register ecosystem, but the currently available register-based diabetes classifiers have yet to incorporate this data despite previous recommendations, as described in @sec-id-t2d-registers. Wishing to take advantage of this data, we developed a new classifier, the OSDC.

As a point of reference in validation, we developed an implementation of the algorithms of the RSCD diabetes classifier (version 1.0, August 2016) according to official documentation.^27^

The following sections describe the algorithms behind these diabetes classifiers.

*\[detailed discussion of choices in OSDC, e.g. on obstetric coding, and pros/cons of RSCD goes in chapter 5\]*

## Validation Questionnaire data

### The Health In Central Denmark survey

Describe population, inclusion, responses etc. HICD ref

### The National Health Survey

Describe population, inclusion, responses etc. NHS ref. This survey was only used for supplementary validation analyses.

## Study design and population

Study I was designed to examine the validity of register-based definitions of T1D and T2D, the latter of which was used to identify the population-wide study populations in studies II and III.

*\[Overview table of the three studies\]*
