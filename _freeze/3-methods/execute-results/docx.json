Secondly, the diabetes classification algorithms used in the project are described, as well as the sources of survey data used to validate them. The last half of the chapter goes over the study designs, populations and statistical methods of the three papers associated with the dissertation, as well as ethical approvals.\n\n## Setting: The Danish healthcare system\n\nDenmark is divided into 5 administrative regions that are responsible for providing public healthcare services to their residents through public hospitals and contract agreements with private actors in the primary care sector. Private actors include GPs and other specialist practices (e.g. ophthalmologists), as well as other healthcare professionals (e.g. podiatrists). In addition, the 98 Danish municipalities are obliged to offer resources to prevent and/or manage chronic disease, such as programs on managing T2D through diet and physical exercise.\n\nAlthough referral to outpatient hospital care is possible, patients with T2D are primarily treated at the GP, which native Danes and migrants with residence permit have free access to. In the tax-funded Danish public healthcare system, Danish citizens and migrants with residence permit have equal access to services, and nearly all services are provided free of charge, although T2D patients incur some out-of-pocket co-payments for podiatrist care and prescription drug purchases at pharmacies. Yearly co-payments towards medication expenditures are partially covered from €132 and expenditures beyond €553 are fully covered (2019 limits),[@reimbursement] while 50% of all expenditures towards diabetes-specific podiatrist care are covered by the the public health insurance.[@okportal]\n\n## Register data sources\n\nIn Denmark, civil registration, public healthcare contacts, and drug prescriptions are recorded with a unique personal identifier (the *CPR number*) given to all Danish residents at immigration or birth. This enables coverage of the entire population and complete linkage between data sources, and forms the foundation of several nationwide Danish healthcare registers.[@regsoverview] The following section briefly describes the data extracted from these registers, as well as other data sources used in the PhD project. A detailed list of variables and code values used is available in [Appendix -@sec-supplementary-material].\n\n### The Danish Civil Registration System\n\nThe Danish Civil Registration System contains civil registration data on all residents in Denmark. Information on migrations and country of origin was extracted, in addition to data on age, sex, equivalised disposable household income,[@eurostat_equiv] employment status, and region of residence.\n\n### The Danish National Patient Register\n\nThe Danish National Patient Register contains information on all hospital admissions and outpatient contacts. Data on diagnoses of diabetes and cardiovascular complications, and procedures relating to retinal screening and treatment of cardiovascular complications was extracted from 1994 through 2018. At the time of this PhD project, the clinical coding system in use was the International Classification of Diseases, $10^{th}$ revision (*ICD-10*), implemented in 1994.[@icd10]\n\n### The Danish National Health Service Register\n\nThe Danish National Health Service Register contains information on all public healthcare services provided in the primary care sector. The data is essentially billing information, and serves as the basis for payment to the healthcare provider from the Danish regions. Each type of service has a unique *SPECIALE*-code (e.g. all diabetes-specific podiatrist care services are contained as sub-codes under *SPECIALE*-code 54) Information on diabetes-specific services performed at podiatrist and ophthalmologist practices from 1990 through 2018 was extracted, as well as point-of-care HbA1c testing performed at GPs.\n\n### The Danish National Prescription Registry\n\nThe Danish National Prescription Registry contains information on all prescription drug purchases at Danish pharmacies, classified according to the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) Classification. These registrations serve to determine reimbursement awarded to each purchase from the public health insurance. Information on purchases of GLD, LLD, ACEI, ARB, and APT from 1995 through 2018 was extracted.\n\n### The Danish Register of Laboratory Results for Research\n\nThe Danish Register of Laboratory Results for Research contains information on clinical biomarker samples analysed at clinical biochemistry departments in hospitals around Denmark. With the exception of point-of-care tests, all biomarker samples taken in the primary healthcare sector are sent for analysis in hospital laboratories. Compared to the other registers, this is a relatively new data source, initially launched in 2013, and only recently achieved nationwide coverage.[@rlrr]\n\nAt the time of data extraction, the Central Denmark Region, one of five administrative regions in Denmark (population of 1.3 million inhabitants, 22% of the entire Danish population) was not yet covered in the register. To address this issue, laboratory results from this part of the the population were extracted directly from the *Clinical Laboratory Information System*, a clinical database that stores all laboratory results analysed in Central Denmark Region. Data on HbA1c, LDL-C, and UACR analyses were extracted from 2011 through 2018.\n\n## Diabetes classification algorithms\n\nAs described previously in @sec-register-based-diabetes-classifiers, currently available register-based diabetes classifiers have yet to incorporate the emerging register data on routine HbA1c testing, despite recommendations to do so. Wishing to take advantage of this data, we developed a new classifier, the OSDC. As a point of reference, we developed an implementation of the RSCD diabetes classifier (version 1.0, August 2016) according to official documentation.[@ruks1doc]\n\nThe following sections describe the algorithms behind the two diabetes classifiers. Overall design and flow of populations are summarised in @fig-classifier-diffs. Pros and cons of their design are discussed in [Chapter -@sec-discussion-of-methods].\n\n::: {#fig-classifier-diffs}\n[![Click to enlarge figure](figures/classifierdiffs)](https://aastedet.github.io/dissertation/figures/classifierdiffs.svg)\n\nOverall classifier design and population flow in the Register for selected Chronic Diseases (RSCD) and the Open-Source Diabetes Classifier (OSDC).\n:::\n\n### The Open-Source Diabetes Classifier\n\nThis classifier first identifies a population of individuals with any type of diabetes mellitus, and then splits this population into T1D and T2D by identifying individuals with T1D and classifying the remainder of the diabetes population as T2D.\n\nIn OSDC, diabetes is defined at the second occurrence of any event across the four types of inclusion events listed below. All available data is used, except purchases of GLD, which are restricted to data from 1997 onwards.\n\ni.  HbA1c measurements of ≥48 mmol/mol, after censoring:\n    -   Results of samples taken during pregnancies - potential gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM).\nii. Hospital diagnoses of diabetes.\niii. Diabetes-specific services received at podiatrist.\niv. Purchases of GLD after censoring:\n    1.  Brand drugs for weight loss, e.g. *Saxenda.*\n\n    2.  Purchases during pregnancies - potential treatment of GDM.\n\n    3.  Metformin purchases in women below age 40 - potential treatment of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).\n\nDiabetes type is classified as either T1D or T2D based on patterns of purchases of insulins (including analogues) and hospital primary diagnoses of T1D and T2D. Classification as T1D requires an individual to fulfill either of the following criteria:\n\na.  Must have purchased only insulins and never any other type of GLD, and have at least one diagnosis of T1D\n\nb.  Must have a majority of T1D diagnoses from endocrinological departments (or from other medical departments, in the absence of contacts to endocrinological departments), and a purchase of insulin within 180 days after onset of diabetes, with insulin contributing at least two thirds of all defined daily doses of GLD purchased.[@ddd]\n\nIn populations generated on a fixed index date (such as the cross-sectional studies associated with this dissertation), individuals classified as T1D must have purchased insulins in the last year prior to the index date.\n\nIndividuals not classified as T1D are classified as T2D.\n\n### The Register of Selected Chronic Diseases\n\nFormally, the RSCD includes two separate algorithms, RSCD-T1D and RSCD-T2D, that identify T1D and T2D, respectively. In practice, however, they are inter-dependent, as individuals identified by the T2D classifier are excluded from the T1D classifier.\n\nIn RSCD, diabetes is defined by type-specific diagnoses of T1D or T2D, and purchases of GLD. Individuals are defined as having T1D or T2D if they meet any of the algorithm's inclusion criteria without fulfilling any of its exclusion criteria.\n\n#### Classification of type 2 diabetes\n\nFor classification of T2D, inclusion criteria include:\n\ni.  Any purchases of non-insulin GLD.\nii. A hospital diagnosis of T2D as the most recent type-specific diabetes diagnosis.\n\nExclusions from the T2D population include:\n\na.  Women that have only purchased metformin and have any diagnoses of PCOS, purchases of clomifene or combination drugs containing antiandrogens and estrogens.\nb.  Individuals with only one recorded inclusion event.\nc.  Individuals with no recorded inclusion events in the last 10 years prior to the index date.\n\n#### Classification of type 1 diabetes\n\nFor classification of T1D, inclusion criteria include:\n\ni.  Any purchases of insulins.\nii. A hospital diagnosis of T1D as the most recent type-specific diabetes diagnosis.\n\nExclusions from the T1D population include:\n\na.  Women with any diagnoses of GDM, who have made purchases of GLD only in the period between 280 days prior to their first diagnosis of GDM and 280 days after their last diagnosis of GDM.\nb.  Individuals classified as T2D.\nc.  Individuals without any purchases of GLD, or have made only one purchase and have no hospital records of T1D.\nd.  Individuals with no insulin purchases in the last 10 years prior to the index date.\n\n## Questionnaire data used in validation\n\nTo validate the above diabetes classifiers, self-reported data from two surveys was retrieved. The design and contents of these surveys is described below.\n\n### The Health In Central Denmark survey\n\nHealth in Central Denmark is a digital and postal questionnaire survey conducted in the Central Denmark Region. The survey was conducted in 2020 on all inhabitants aged 18 to 74 years identified as prevalent diabetes cases by OSDC on 31 Dec 2018, plus an equally-sized group of OSDC non-diabetes cases (matched to diabetes cases by sex, age, and municipality). The survey collected self-reported data related to health in general, with an additional focus on items related to diabetes mellitus, such as current disease, diabetes type, and age at onset.In total, 44,659 OSDC diabetes cases and 46,195 matched OSDC non-diabetes cases were invited to the survey, and 51,854 (57%) responded.[@hicd]\n\n### The National Health Survey\n\nThe National Health Survey is a repeated digital and postal questionnaire survey conducted among a representative sample of Danish residents aged 16 or above. It collects self-reported data related to mental and physical health in general, such as current or former chronic diseases, and includes a question on diabetes of any type.[@nhs] In the 2017 survey of Central Denmark Region, 52,000 individuals were invited and 32,400 (62%) responded. Data from this survey was used in supplementary validation analyses.\n\n## Study design and population\n\nIn addition to developing a code package for the statistical programming language *R* containing the source-code behind the diabetes classifiers, three studies were conducted. Study I was designed to examine the validity of register-based definitions of T1D and T2D. After validating the two candidates, the most accurate classifier - OSDC - was chosen to identify study populations of T2D for use in studies II and III.\n\n*\\[Overview table of the three studies\\]*\n\n### Study populations\n\n#### Study I\n\nValidation analyses were performed in a subset of respondents in the Health in Central Denmark survey.\n\nAmong survey respondents, 2,411 were excluded due to missing data on diabetes items. 2,093 individuals with self-reported onset of diabetes after 31 December 2018 were excluded, as diabetes cases onset after the index date would erroneously evaluate to false-negative cases in the register-based classifiers, due to the delay from register-classification on the index date (31 December 2018) until questionnaire responses (November 2020).\n\nAfter these exclusions, 47,350 individuals remained, but due to survey invites being conditioned on OSDC diabetes status, the survey population was biased towards the OSDC classification and OSDC diabetes prevalence was 43.7% (20,692 individuals). To account for this, we first estimated the OSDC diabetes prevalence to be 9.3% (2,483 individuals) in a random sample of 26,665 individuals from the background population with the same age, sex and municipality distributions as the OSDC non-diabetes cases of respondents. To offset the oversampling of OSDC diabetes cases in the survey, OSDC diabetes cases were randomly subsampled to 2,733 individuals to achieve an unbiased OSDC diabetes prevalence of 9.3% in the final study population of 29,391 individuals.\n\n#### Study II\n\nRegister data was used to identify 262,837 individuals with prevalent T2D on 1 January 2018 (index date) from a background population of 3,864,528 native Danes or first-generation migrants from the selected origin categories aged 25 - 99 years, and residing at least 3 years in Denmark on the index date.\n\nT2D prevalence was studied in the above population. In order to study T2D care where it was clinically relevant, the eleven analyses of T2D care were performed in a distinct subsets of the population with T2D, as outlined below:\n\n-   All analyses of T2D care were performed in a subset of 254,097 individuals with T2D onset at least 6 months prior to the index date in order to allow time for baseline-screening, initiation of pharmacological treatment and subsequent biomarker control to occur in the newly-diagnosed.\n    -   Monitoring was evaluated among all these individuals:\n        -   Monitoring of HbA1c, LDL-C, nephropathy, retinopathy and foot disease: 254,097 individuals.\n    -   Biomarker levels were evaluated in those with at least one measurement prior to the index date:\n        -   HbA1c levels: 250,075 individuals.\n        -   LDL-C levels: 248,813 individuals.\n    -   Each analysis of pharmacological treatment was limited to individuals with a clear guideline-recommendation for that particular treatment according to complication status or biomarker levels on the index date (excluding individuals not alive and resident in Denmark in the year following the index date and thus unable to purchase medication):\n        -   GLD. HbA1c ≥48 mmol/mol at the most recent measurement: 140,208 individuals.\n        -   LLD. Prevalent macrovascular complications or DKD, or age above 40 with LDL-C above 2.5 mmol/L: 128,707 individuals.\n        -   ACEI/ARB & APT. Prevalent macrovascular complications or DKD: 77,414 individuals.\n\n#### Study III\n\nRegister data was used to identify 275,525 individuals with prevalent T2D on 1 January 2019 (index date) from a background population of 4,084,564 individuals above age 25. Among individuals with T2D, 269,011 native Danes or first-generation migrants from the selected origin categories residing at least 3 years in Denmark on the index date were included. After exclusion of 5,518 individuals without records of HbA1c or LDL-cholesterol, the study population contained 263,393 individuals. A subsequent analysis of GLD use in the year 2021 was performed on 241,140 individuals from the above study population still alive and residing in Denmark on 1 January 2021.\n\n### Outcomes\n\n#### Study I\n\nThe validation golden standard, self-reported diabetes type, was categorized as either T1D (self-reported T1D), T2D (all other types of diabetes) or no diabetes, corresponding to the diabetes types discernable by the register-based classifiers.\n\n#### Study II\n\nTwelve outcomes were defined as follows:\n\n1.  Prevalent T2D was defined as OSDC-classified T2D prevalent on the index date.\n\nT2D care quality was evaluated in the scope of failure to meet guideline recommendations in terms of monitoring, biomarker levels, and pharmacological treatment.\n\nT2D monitoring was evaluated in time-frames prior to index date matching guideline-recommendations, with three months of leeway added (e.g. monitoring within 15 months is considered guideline-fulfilling, even if the specific type of monitoring is recommended yearly in guidelines):\n\n2.  Monitoring of HbA1c was identified by records of biomarker samples between October 1, 2016 and December 31, 2017 in the *Register of Laboratory Results for Research* or the *Clinical Laboratory Information System*. Additional monitoring of HbA1c using point-of-care tests was identified by records in the *National Health Service Register*.\n3.  Monitoring of LDL-C: was identified by records of biomarker samples between October 1, 2016 and December 31, 2017 in the *Register of Laboratory Results for Research* or the *Clinical Laboratory Information System*.\n4.  UACR-screening for diabetic nephropathy were identified by records of biomarker samples between October 1, 2016 and December 31, 2017 in the *Register of Laboratory Results for Research* or the *Clinical Laboratory Information System*.\n5.  Screening for diabetic retinopathy was identified by records of retinal photoscreening for diabetic retinopathy between October 1, 2015 and December 31, 2017 - either at hospital departments in the *National Patient Register*, or diabetes-specific examinations at ophthalmologist practice recorded in the *National Health Service Register .*\n6.  Screening for diabetic foot disease was identified by records of diabetes-specific podiatrist services received between October 1, 2016 and December 31, 2017 in the *National Health Service Register.*\n\nBiomarker levels on the index date was evaluated using the most recent measurement of HbA1c and LDL-C before the index date:\n\n7.  The outcome measure for HbA1c control was a level ≥53 mmol/mol.\n8.  For LDL-C, the outcome measure was a level ≥2.6 mmol/L.\n\nPharmacological treatment was assessed in the year following the index date, and treatment was defined by at least one purchase of the respective type of drug based on the following ATC codes (including subcodes):\n\n9.  GLD: ATC codes A10.\n10. LLD: ATC codes C10.\n11. ACEI/ARB: ATC codes C09A-C09D.\n12. APT: ATC codes B01AC.\n\n#### Study III\n\nEight outcomes were defined across combination therapy and individual GLD types used.\n\nGLD combination therapy was analysed using the following two outcome definitions:\n\n1.  Any combination therapy: two or more GLD types purchased in the year\n\n2.  Triple combination therapy: three or more GLD types purchased in the year.\n\nPurchases of the following types of GLD during the respective year of analysis (2019 and 2021) counted towards the total number of drugs used by an individual in a year (fixed-dose combination drugs counting towards both of their component drug types), and these purchases also defined the six outcomes for analysis of individual GLD type usage:\n\n3.  Metformin: ATC codes A10BA02, A10BD0, A10BD10-16, A10BD20, A10BD23.\n4.  Sulfonylureas: ATC codes A10BB.\n5.  DPP4i: ATC codes A10BH, A10BD0, A10BD10-11, A10BD13, A10BD19, A10BD21, A10BD24.\n6.  SGLT2i: ATC codes A10BK, A10BD15-24, A10BX09, A10BX11-12.\n7.  Insulins (including analogues): ATC codes A10A.\n8.  GLP1RA: ATC codes A10BJ, A10AE5, A10BX04, A10BX07, A10BX10, A10BX13-14.\n\nIn addition, thiazolidinediones (ATC codes A10BG) and repaglinide (ATC codes A10BX02) counted towards GLD combination therapy, but were not analysed as individual drug types due to the very low prevalence of use of these drugs.\n\n### Primary variable of interest: migrant status\n\nMigrant status and country of origin was defined according to the definitions by Statistics Denmark. In order to accomodate the expected heterogeneity between different countries of origin, aggregation of countries was limited to countries with similar reasons for migration, and racial and cultural similarities. Based on the national origins with the most T2D cases and the United Nations M49 geoscheme, the population was grouped into nine origin categories:\n\n-   Native Danes\n-   Europe (M49: Europe, except countries of the former Yugoslavia)\n-   Middle East (M49: Northern Africa, Western Asia except Turkey, plus Afghanistan and Iran)\n\nAnd the six remaining individual countries with the most T2D cases (in order of number of cases):\n\n-   Turkey\n-   Former Yugoslavia\n-   Pakistan\n-   Sri Lanka\n-   Somalia\n-   Vietnam\n\n### Other explanatory variables\n\n#### Socioeconomic variables\n\nAge and diabetes-duration on index dates were treated as continuous variables. Household income was based on the 3-year average of equivalised disposable household income prior to index dates, converted to the corresponding percentile in the background population and treated as a continuous variable. As a measure of acculturation, duration of residence was calculated from the date of first migration into Denmark, converted to a categorical variable with native Danes categorized in the maximally acculturated group. Employment status was categorized as *Employed* (including students and others), *Retired* or *Unemployed* based on the year prior to index dates.\n\n#### Clinical variables\n\nPrevalent macrovascular complications were assessed by primary diagnosis codes of stroke, ischemic heart disease and peripheral arterial disease (and associated procedure codes) prior to index dates. Diabetic kidney disease was defined as a UACR ≥300 mg/g measured within three years prior to index dates (study II: within 27 months). Other types of microvascular complications were not included due to insufficient data.\n\nStudy III used HbA1c levels and LDL-C levels at baseline as continuous covariates for adjustment, as well as LLD use within a year prior to the index date. Finally, analyses of the use of individual GLD drug types in study III adjusted for combination therapy categorized as *Monotherapy or no GLD*, *Dual combination* and *Triple combination or more*.\n\n## Statistical analysis\n\nStatistical analyses were performed in RStudio[@RStudio] using R version 4[@R] and a range of open-source code packages for computations[@datatable; @Epi; @finalfit; @tidyverse; @geepack] and visualisation.[@diagrammer; @khroma]\n\nThis section describes our overall statistical analysis strategy, followed by the specific statistical analyses of each study.\n\nLogistic regression - a statistical model that computes odds ratios (OR) between groups - is often applied in cross-sectional studies to estimate relative risk (RR, or risk ratio). However, odds ratios approximate relative risk **only** when the outcome is *rare*. If this is not the case, interpreting ORs as RRs will exaggerate risk estimates,[@Grant2014] as illustrated in @fig-or-rr (adapted from [D Wells - CC-BY-SA](https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=100175653)).\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Relationship between odds ratio and relative risk depending on baseline risk.](3-methods_files/figure-docx/fig-or-rr-1.png){#fig-or-rr}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nNone of the outcomes in studies II & III were expected to be rare, and thus logistic regression was unsuitable. While log-binomial regression models are the most natural choice for computing relative risk in a mathematical sense, they are prone to convergence failure.[@convergencefail] Given the large number of outcomes and models that needed fitting, this presented a serious (although not insurmountable) inconvenience, and log-binomial regression was also discarded.\n\nRobust Poisson regression (sometimes termed modified Poisson regression)[@Zou2004] presented an appealing alternative for modeling RR. A comprehensive description of the technique is beyond the scope of this dissertation, but a brief explanation is in order, since ordinary Poisson regression is not the right tool for modeling binary outcomes as such data violate the assumptions behind the model.[@regresscounts] When applied to binomial data, the error for the estimated relative risk will be overestimated in an ordinary Poisson model. However, this problem can be addressed by using robust generalized estimating equations (so-called *sandwich*) variance estimates, which provide accurate standard errors in the presence of over-dispersion and excess zeros,[@Greenland2004] such as in a binary distribution. Ultimately, this allows robust Poisson regression to estimate RR with valid confidence intervals in data with binary outcomes.[@compareperformance] It is worth noting that RR is merely a measure of relative probability, despite the semantics around *risk* implying that an adverse outcome is under study, which is not necessarily the case.\n\nAll regression models were modeled with native Danes as the reference group. To account for potential non-linearity, continuous variables were modeled as natural splines with knots placed at each quintile of the distribution in the respective study population. Supplementary analyses where continuous variable were modeled as categorical variables (quintiles) were conducted for easier interpretation of these variables. Supplementary analyses also included estimates of absolute risk differences corresponding to the above analyses. In these analyses, a generalized linear model using a Gaussian distribution and identity link with robust *sandwich* variance estimates was used to compute absolute risk difference with 95% confidence intervals.\n\nIn all three studies, the characteristics of study populations were presented, describing continuous variables with means and standard differences, and categorical variables by absolute numbers and percentage proportions. In study I, characteristics were tabulated according to self-reported, OSDC-classified, and RSCD-classified diabetes type, while study II and III tabulated the distribution of covariates and outcomes by origin group.\n\nThe following sections describes the statistical analyses of each study.\n\n#### Study I\n\nValidation analyses were performed separately for T1D and T2D, where each register-based diabetes classifier was validated against self-reported diabetes type. Within analyses of each diabetes type, diabetes type was modeled as a distinct binary variable: does the individual have this diabetes type or not (e.g. in the analyses of T1D, diabetes type was modeled as a binary variable of T1D vs. no T1D, the latter category including both T2D and non-diabetes cases).\n\nConcordance tables and associated validation metrics were computed (with 95% confidence intervals) as defined in equations [-@eq-sens], [-@eq-spec], [-@eq-ppv], and [-@eq-npv]: sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV). These validation analyses were bootstrapped in 1000 random subsamples in order to assess robustness.\n\n$$ Sensitivity = \\frac{N_{true positives}}{N_{true positives}+N_{false negatives}}$$ {#eq-sens}\n\n$$ Specificity = \\frac{N_{true negatives}}{N_{true negatives}+N_{false positives}}$$ {#eq-spec}\n\n$$ PPV = \\frac{N_{true positives}}{N_{true positives}+N_{false positives}}$$ {#eq-ppv}\n\n$$ NPV = \\frac{N_{true negatives}}{N_{true negatives}+N_{false negatives}}$$ {#eq-npv}\n\nFurthermore, analyses stratified by self-reported age at onset of diabetes (including all self-reported non-diabetes cases in both strata of age at onset) were performed to assess the influence of age at onset of diabetes on sensitivity and PPV.\n\n#### Study II\n\nRobust Poisson regression was used to compute RR and 95% confidence intervals in a series of cross-sectional analyses of T2D prevalence and eleven outcomes within T2D care.\n\nIn the analysis of T2D prevalence, RR of prevalent T2D was computed in a crude model and in two models with different levels of adjustment to explore the effects of clinical (model 1) and socioeconomic factors (model 2) on migrant risks. The first model adjusted for sex and age (model 1); the second model further adjusted for employment status, household income, duration of residence, and region of residence (model 2). Additionally, age-specific T2D prevalence in each migrant group was modeled using a binomial model with log-link and restricted cubic splines as a function of age.\n\nIn the eleven analyses of T2D care, the RR of not receiving each type of guideline-level T2D care was computed in a crude model and in two adjusted models to visualize risk disparities in a clinical context separately from the fully-adjusted model. The first model (model 1) adjusted for clinical risk factors in diabetes that may influence decision-making when planning diabetes care with the patient (sex, age, diabetes duration, prevalent macrovascular complications and DKD). The fully-adjusted model (model 2) further adjusted for socioeconomic factors that may influence a patient's health behavior and healthcare service usage (employment status, household income, duration of residence, and region of residence).\n\nIn order to assess potential disparities at other cut-off values of HbA1c and LDL-C, cumulative empirical distributions were plotted with 95% confidence intervals computed with Kolmogorov-Smirnov's *D*.\n\n#### Study III\n\nSimilar to study II, robust Poisson regression was used to compute RR with 95% confidence intervals in three models for each outcome: an unadjusted model (crude), a model adjusted for clinical risk factors (model 1), and a model adjusted for clinical and socioeconomic factors (model 2). Compared to the models in study II, all adjusted models in this study contained adjustment for additional clinical risk factors (HbA1c level, LDL-C level, and lipid-lowering drug usage), and the analyses of individual GLD type also including adjustment for the degree of combination therapy.\n\n## Ethics and approvals\n\nIn compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation, the handling of personal data associated with this PhD project was registered in the internal register of research projects (Danish: *fortegnelsen*) of Aarhus University, journal number 2016-051-000001, serial number 1339.
