Also thanks to the R-foundation, RStudio/Posit, open-source package developers and the R biostatistics group at University of Bergen for providing a Quarto template for this dissertation.\n\nAlso thanks to family, friends & colleagues at the Department of Public Health and the Research Unit for General Practice being nice. Thanks to supervisors for discovering when I didn't know what I was doing and for being patient, supportive and insightful throughout.\n\nThank you to fellow researchers at Steno Diabetes Center Aarhus for great discussions about diabetes, tools and methodology.\n\nAlso a special thanks to Luke Johnston, for inspiring me to strive for openness and better programming practices, and thank you to fellow teachers and contributors to the *R for Reproducible Research* courses. I hope my work honors the spirit of open science.\n\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.content-hidden when-format=\"pdf\"}\n\n## Notes on website version {.unnumbered .unlisted}\n\nThis website contains my PhD dissertation in html form. In terms of content, it is practically identical to the pdf-file submitted to the graduate school - both were made with [QuartoÂ®](https://quarto.org/), an open-source scientific and technical publishing system.\n:::",
