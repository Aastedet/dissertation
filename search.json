    "text": "Motivation\nDuring my work as a junior doctor in a general practice in Gellerup, a deprived suburb of Aarhus with a large migrant population, I was immediately struck by the high frequency of type 2 diabetes (T2D) and other chronic diseases among day-to-day consultations. I would quickly learn that T2D held more surprises for me than just a high prevalence, and after just a few weeks it seemed that much of what I had learned about the disease in medical school and studied in clinical guidelines did not apply in my new setting. Patients were not only more prevalent, they were also much younger, and hemoglobin-A1c (HbA1c) levels rarely came close to guideline targets despite our best efforts to intensify treatment. Sadly, these experiences would repeat themselves in my subsequent work with migrants as a general practitioner (GP) in health clinics of the Danish Red Cross at asylum residence centers and pre-removal detention centers.\nAs I reviewed the literature, I understood why medical school and guidelines had failed to prepare me for the challenges I faced as a clinician with T2D in migrants: the existing literature was inadequate. While increased prevalence of T2D appeared well-established, and migrants with T2D were also ascribed a higher mortality than their native counterparts, this provided little guidance for my day-to-day work. Contrarily, there was hardly any evidence on disparities in the time between diagnosis and death - the time when care from the GP is needed the most. So I was left to wonder what might cause this discordance between what I knew about T2D from books and guidelines, and what I encountered in migrants in the clinic.\nAre migrants with T2D more prone to under-treatment, and in which areas of care?\nAre some migrant groups more prone to under-treatment than others?\nAre their needs for T2D care simply greater?\nKnowledge on these clinical questions would enable GPs and healthcare planners to address disparities and improve care in migrants by prioritizing and focusing care accordingly. Migrants are currently a younger demographic than the rest of the population, but as time causes the migrant demographic to age, it is likely that migrants will constitute an increasing proportion of the T2D population in the coming years. Therefore, I was excited to explore these urgent clinical questions as a researcher, hoping I could provide answers to myself and fellow GPs that could lead to better care - and, ultimately, better health - in a vulnerable and challenging group of patients.\nDuring my time as a PhD student, I quickly encountered the first of many challenges on the way to studying migrants with T2D in the Danish registers: there was no validated definition of T2D, nor a common consensus among researchers. This led to the PhD project expanding its scope to develop and validate a tool to define T2D in the Danish registers, which allowed me to answer my research questions based on robust findings. This PhD project benefited greatly from open-source tools, and in the spirit of open science, the source code of the validated diabetes classifier was made available to other researchers in the osdc package for the R statistical programming language. As a final commitment to openness, this dissertation was made available to a global audience in website format at aastedet.github.io/dissertation/."

    "section": "1.1 Migrants and type 2 diabetes",
    "text": "1.1 Migrants and type 2 diabetes\nT2D constitutes the vast majority of all diabetes cases, and disproportionally affects the socially deprived demographics in societies across the globe[manglerref]. The prevalence of type 2 diabetes (T2D) today exceeds half a billion people globally and is on the rise due to several factors, including population aging, urbanization, adoption of energy-dense diets, and sedentary lifestyles. These transitions are occurring at a rapid pace in developing countries, where they affect the largest number of people1. Many developing countries have populations with a genetic predisposition to developing T2D, which exacerbates the impact of these transitions.\nMigrants are particularly vulnerable to T2D, as they are positioned at the point of convergence of these exposures: genetic predisposition, rapid lifestyle transitions, and the disparate social impact of T2D. After being granted residence permit in Denmark and other developed nations, migrants are often housed in densely-populated urban areas and exposed to drastic lifestyle transitions. Migrants may also suffer from previous mental and physical trauma, which - in addition to cultural and language barriers - can limit their ability to gain higher-income employment and escape their disadvantageous socioeconomic position.\nIn Denmark and many other developed nations, healthcare systems are facing a challenge to sustain the expected high quality of care in an aging population with a growing burden of chronic diseases and comorbidities. Prioritization of limited resources is crucial to ensure that those with the highest need for (and potential benefit from) healthcare receive adequate care. Migrant origin is a well-established risk factor of T2D, and migrants have a higher prevalence of T2D compared to native populations today[manglerref], but the increased risk of developing T2D is partially mitigated by their younger age. However, this only delays the impact of their increased T2D risk, and as these migrant populations age in the coming years, they will make up a growing proportion of T2D patients in the country - 9% of immigrants in Denmark were aged 66 years and above in 2019, a proportion projected to double by 20392. Therefore, understanding potential disparities in care and the specific healthcare needs of migrant populations with T2D can inform the prioritization of healthcare resources, ultimately ensuring that all individuals with T2D can continue to receive appropriate care.\nCurrently, there is a lack of evidence on T2D care in migrants, and research in this area faces several challenges that may explain the scarsity of evidence. Not only are migrants a minority, which limits the size of potential study populations, they are often a hard-to-reach group in studies that require patient engagement for inclusion, which exacerbates sample size problems and can induce selection bias in such study designs. Furthermore, migrants have historically been defined by their racial appearance and ethnic minorities categorized accordingly, particularly in Europe and the United States. While these categories allow researchers to identify racial minorities, they obscure the role of migrants in the modern era, and provide only indirect evidence on migrant minority groups3."

    "section": "1.2 Migrants in Denmark",
    "text": "1.2 Migrants in Denmark\nIn 2019, Denmark had a population of approximately 5.8 million residents, of whom 600.000 (10%) were migrants and 1 million (18%) were aged 66 years and older. By 2039, the population is expected to have grown to 6.2 million, with a migrant population of 750.000 (12%) and 1.5 million individuals (23%) aged 66 years and older.2 Figure 1.1 shows the projected demographics of native Danes and migrants.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Native Danes 2019-2039\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Migrants 2019-2039\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.1: Demographic projections of native Danes (a) and migrants (b) in 2039. Demographics in 2019 are outlined in green. Adapted from Statistics Denmark2\n\n\n\n1.2.1 Migration\nIndividuals migrate between countries for various reasons, such as the pursuit of work, education and family reunification, or to seek protection. Due to different international rights, a clear legal distinction is made between ‘refugees’ and ‘migrants’. Refugees are defined by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, and protected in accordance with international law:\n\nRefugees are persons who are outside their country of origin for reasons of feared persecution, conflict, generalized violence, or other circumstances that have seriously disturbed public order and, as a result, require international protection.4\n\nBy contrast, there is no formal legal definition of an international migrant, although anyone changing country of usual residence, irrespective of the reason for migration or legal status, is generally considered a migrant.4\nIn Denmark, migrants seeking protection are processed by authorities to determine if they quality for refugee status, and whether they have previously applied for asylum elsewhere in the European Union per the Dublin Regulation.5 Individuals qualifying for refugee status are granted asylum and receive residence permits. Conversely, individuals with immediate family members holding Danish citizenship (or with residence permit granted for reasons other than refugee status) can apply for a residence permit on grounds of family reunification before entering the country,6 and residence permits can also be granted to citizens of the European Union, as well as individuals with work or study obligations in Denmark.7,8 Citizens of Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden are free to enter, reside and work in Denmark.9\nOnce residence has been granted, regardless of the reason, these individuals have access to the same public healthcare services as Danish citizens.\n\n\n1.2.2 Migrants in the Danish data infrastructure\nIn the context of Danish registers and this PhD project, both refugees and immigrants are referred to as migrants after obtaining residence. In contrast to the automated collection of data on events occurring in Denmark, migrants and their past pose a challenge to register data collection.\nBasic civil registration data on migrants is collected during processing of residence applications. Generally, registrations pertaining to events that occurred in another country prior to immigration require technical evidence (e.g. clinical imaging to determine age and verify date of birth) or legal proof from the issuing authority of the country where the event occurred. However, in cases where such documentation is unavailable, registrations may be supported by undocumented information provided by the migrant.10 In cases where information was not systematically collected at the time of migration, e.g. an individual’s level of education attained before migration, surveys have been used to collect this data retrospectively, or it may be imputed based on available data.11\n\n\n1.2.3 Migrant groups in Denmark\nIn Danish civil register data, a migrant’s country of origin is defined by Statistics Denmark according to the following rules (paraphrased):\n\nAn immigrant is a person born abroad to non-Danish citizens. If Danish civil records contain data on a migrant’s mother, country of origin is defined by the mother’s country of birth. Otherwise the father’s country of birth is used, or - if no data is available - country of origin is defined by the country of birth of the immigrant themselves.12\n\nMigrants from more than 200 different countries of origin reside in Denmark, making the migrant group very heterogenous with respect to geographic and cultural background.12 Furthermore, the context of migration differs greatly between migrants of different origins in terms of when and why a particular minority migrated to Denmark. For example, the vast majority of migrants from Turkey were granted residence due to work and family reunification in the 1960s and 1970s, while almost all migrants from Bosnia-Herzegovina were refugees from the Yugoslav wars of the 1990s. By contrast, migrants from other European countries came to Denmark mainly for work, education or other reasons at various points in time. Figure 1.2 shows the primary reason for migration among the largest migrant origin groups residing in Denmark, while Figure 1.3 shows the calendar year of immigration in different migrant groups.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Reason for migration: Western countries\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Reason for migration: Non-western countries\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.2: Primary reason for migration among the 10 largest migrant groups in Denmark from Western (a) and Non-western countries (b). Adapted from Statistics Denmark.13\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.3: Calendar year of first immigration among the 12 largest migrant groups residing in Denmark in 2019. Adapted from Statistics Denmark.12\n\n\nThe limited size of each ethnic minority and the strongly contrasting characteristics between them poses a challenge to statistical processing. Researchers must strike a balance between aggregation to achieve adequate sample sizes while preserving clinically meaningful minority groups, and avoid introducing biases due to aggregation of dissimilar groups.14 For statistical purposes, different geoschemes have been used by different institutions depending on the context and purpose. The Statistical Division of the United Nations developed the M49 Standard Country or Area Codes for Statistical Use,15 while Statistics Denmark group migrants into Western and Non-western countries, respectively, a grouping that resembles the more widely-used classification of developed and developing countries.16 See Chapter 3 for a description of grouping of countries of origin in the context of this PhD project.\n\n\n1.2.4 Descendants\nDescendants of migrants pose an additional challenge to classification for research purposes, as they can be considered part of the migrant group, the native population, or their own distinct demographic. In the context of T2D today, descendants of migrants in Denmark are a very young demographic unlikely to constitute a substantial proportion of the patient population (less than 1% of descendants are aged 66 years or older).2 There is also some evidence from Sweden suggesting that descendants are a distinct group from first-generation immigrants in terms of T2D and mortality.17 In the context of this PhD project, descendants were not a focus of investigation, and the term migrants specifically refers to first-generation migrants."

    "section": "1.3 Type 2 diabetes care",
    "text": "1.3 Type 2 diabetes care\n\n1.3.1 Complications and risk factors\n\n1.3.1.1 Overall\nComplications of diabetes are traditionally divided into macrovascular (e.g. cardiovascular disease (CVD)) and microvascular complications (e.g. kidney disease, retinopathy, neuropathy), all of which contribute to morbidity and mortality in T2D. Several lifestyle and physiological factors influence the risk of developing complications, and clinical care revolves around management of these. In addition to being key risk factors of complications, blood pressure and levels of hemoglobin-A1C (HbA1c) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) drive indications for treatment and clinical decision-making in T2D[manglerref].\n\n\n1.3.1.2 In migrants\nIn European countries, HbA1c-levels are higher in migrants than in native populations[manglerref], but LDL-C levels have only been sparsely described. The evidence on complication risk is inconsistent, but indicates a higher risk compared to native populations, although risks differ between complication types, migrant groups and countries. Similarly, higher mortality among migrants with T2D has been reported in some studies [refs], while other studies have found similar or lower risk [manglerrefs]\n\n\n\n1.3.2 Pharmacological treatment\n\n1.3.2.1 Overall\nDue to their effects on HbA1c, LDL-C, and blood pressure, glucose-lowering drugs (GLD), lipid-lowering drugs (LLD), and antihypertensive drugs are critical parts of T2D care. In T2D patients with particularly high risk of complications, pharmacological treatment also includes antiplatelet therapy (APT), as the complication risk-lowering effect outweighs the risk of adverse events in these patients18,19. In addition to their effect on biomarker levels, certain drug types within the above classes of drugs have other positive effects. In particular, the GLD types sodium glucose co-transporter type 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP1RA) substantially reduce the risk of adverse cardiovascular and renal events beyond their effect on HbA1c. Similarly, the antihypertensive drugs types angiotensin-converting enzyme-inhibitors (ACEI) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) reduce the risk and improve the prognosis of diabetic kidney disease (DKD) beyond their effect on blood pressure. [manglerref]\nCombination therapy - the use of multiple drug types with differing mechanisms of action - is a way to increase treatment intensity and achieve treatment goals with fewer side-effects. Combination therapy is particularly important in T2D, as GLD monotherapy fails to achieve target levels of HbA1c in many patients, even at maximal dosage. [manglerref]\n\n\n1.3.2.2 In migrants\nEvidence from several European countries shows that GLDs are prescribed earlier and/or to a larger proportion of migrants compared to native populations[manglerref]. However, disparities in the quality of the prescribed GLD treatment, such as the use of combination therapy or the types of GLD prescribed, has not been studied. Indirect evidence suggests that such disparities are likely, as non-white minorities in the UK were slower and less likely to intensify to combination therapy than white groups[manglerref9], and migrants in Italy with T2D purchased fewer packages of non-insulin GLD per person-year than their native counterparts[manglerref10], and socioeconomic[manglerref21-25] and racial[manglerref22, 24, 27] disparities in prescribing of SGLT2i and GLP1RA have been reported in several countries.\nIn contrast, studies from European countries have reported lower rates of prescribing of LLD in migrants with T2D [care_qual_migrants refs 40, 5, Eastwood]. Treatment with LLD is not indicated in all patients with T2D, however, and only a few of these studies accounted for treatment indication.\nEvidence on ACEI/ARB use and APT in migrants with T2D is very limited, but a study from Italy found lower odds of treatment in most migrant groups [42], indicating a potential for disparities in these areas of care.\n\n\n\n1.3.3 Monitoring\n\n1.3.3.1 Overall\nIn T2D, timely monitoring of risk factors and complications allows faster adjustment of treatment, and monitoring has previously been used as a process indicator of care quality, although the direct evidence on its influence on outcomes is sparse. [see refs [7-12, e.g. https://doi.org/10.1093/intqhc/mzl023, , evt. DVDD rapport]*\n\n\n1.3.3.2 In migrants\nThe evidence on monitoring of T2D in migrants is inconsistent between countries and different aspects of monitoring. In Norway, migrants with T2D received similar or more monitoring than native Norwegians[manglerrefTran2010], while migrants with T2D in Italy received fewer referrals for consultations than native Italians[manglerrefMarchesini2014]."

    "text": "1.4 Clinical guidelines for type 2 diabetes care\nIn Denmark, T2D care is most often provided by general practitioners (GPs) and other actors in the primary care sector, although some patients are treated in the outpatient hospital setting. The Danish College of General Practitioners publishes national clinical guidelines for T2D in cooperation with the Danish Endocrine Society. The guidelines are continuously updated as new evidence emerges. In this PhD project, T2D care was studied in the time period covered by the 201220 and 201921 revisions (only minor changes were made between the two revisions). These guidelines advise that monitoring intervals, biomarker goals and treatment intensity are adapted to fit the individual patient, but specify recommendations that may be used as indicators of care quality.\nDanish guidelines provide virtually no specific recommendations on T2D care in migrants, and migrants are not addressed in the appendix on pharmacological treatment of special groups. Guideline recommendations relevant to this PhD study are described below.\n\n1.4.1 Diagnosis\nHbA1c values \\(\\ge48 mmol/mol\\) are diagnostic of type 2 diabetes, but diagnosis must be confirmed with a repeated sample on a different day. Once diagnosed, patients with T2D should be considered permanently affected by the disease, and the associated risk factors for complications should be treated regardless of subsequent normalization of HbA1c.\nMigrant origin is mentioned as a risk factor of T2D, and guidelines recommend increased HbA1c screening in certain migrant groups.\n\n\n1.4.2 Monitoring\nThe risk biomarkers HbA1c and LDL-C should be measured yearly, as well as urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR) to screen for DKD. Repeated samples of UACR \\(\\ge 300mg/g\\) is considering diagnostic of diabetic kidney disease (DKD). Diabetic retinopathy should be screened by an ophthalmologist every second year and screening for diabetic foot disease by a podiatrist every year. At the initial diagnosis of T2D, a baseline-screening of all five types of monitoring is recommended.\nGuidelines provide no specific recommendations on monitoring in migrants.\n\n\n1.4.3 Biomarker levels\nFor HbA1c, the goal should be the lowest possible level without hypoglycemia or inappropriate polypharmacy. Specific targets at \\(48 mmol/mol\\), \\(53 mmol/mol\\), \\(58 mmol/mol\\), and \\(70 mmol/mol\\) are provided depending on diabetes duration and severity, complications, age and comorbidities.\nFor LDL-C, the level should be as low as possible. A general target below \\(2.6mmol/L\\) is provided, while the target in patients with complications should be below \\(1.8mmol/L\\).\nGuidelines provide no specific recommendations on HbA1c or LDL-C targets in migrants.\n\n\n1.4.4 Pharmacological treatment\n\n1.4.4.1 Glucose-lowering drugs\nCombination therapy: GLD therapy is recommended in patients with HbA1c ≥ 48 mmol/mol, and metformin is the recommended first-line treatment. There is no overall recommendation of second- or third-line drugs, although SGLT2i or GLP1RA should be considered in patients with CVD when metformin or other treatment is insufficient to reach the patient’s HbA1c target (note that, although not in effect during the time period studied in this PhD project, the recommendations for SGLT2i and GLP1RA were expanded in the 2022 revision to include all T2D patients with CVD, multiple risk factors for CVD, or chronic kidney disease, irrespective of HbA1c level).\nIndividual drug types: Guidelines recommend factoring in all effects - positive and negative - as well as cost when choosing between individual drug types, and do not present a fixed hierarchy between GLD drug type. [maybe summarise guideline considerations on second- and third-line drugs, similar to https://vejledninger.dsam.dk/media/238.png]\n\n\n1.4.4.2 Lipid-lowering drugs\nTreatment with LLD is recommended to all individuals with prevalent CVD, diabetic nephropathy, or LDL-C above 2.5 mmol/L.\n\n\n1.4.4.3 Antihypertensive drugs\nIn addition to treatment of hypertension, use of either ACEI or ARB is recommended in individuals with prevalent CVD, microalbuminuria, or diabetic kidney disease.\n\n\n1.4.4.4 Antiplatelet therapy\nAPT is recommended in individuals with prevalent CVD, diabetic kidney disease or very high risk of CVD due to other risk factors (this recommendation was expanded in the 2022 revision to also include individuals with kidney failure and concurrent microalbuminuria).\nGuidelines provide no specific recommendations on any aspect of pharmacological treatment in migrants."

Details in chapter 3.\nHow is the data structured and stored, who can get access - to what, and how?\nResearchers get access to the same raw data, stored in the same structure (unless a data manager on the recipient end edits the raw data during the access data transfer process)\nThe shared data potentially enables reproducible research, if code were also shared publicly (which it is not).\n\n\n1.5.2 Benefits\nHealthcare registers provide a powerful data source for population-wide studies without the need to engage the patient for inclusion. The ability to include all individuals in the population makes them particularly suited for studies of migrants with T2D, where sample size is a limiting factor and other data sources may be vulnerable to selection bias in these groups.\n\n\n1.5.3 Challenges\nGeneral-purpose registers and other administrative databases often provide the basis of diabetes epidemiology, but rarely contain validated diabetes-specific data. If the diabetes-specific data is not accurate, bias may be induced into studies. Thus, it is important to have an accurate tool to identify individuals with diabetes in the registers, as findings may differ with various diabetes definitions. Considerable efforts have been made towards establishing such a tool for diabetes research in several countries, including Denmark.\nInternationally, some algorithms classifying T1D and T2D have been validated in cohorts of individuals with diabetes, but none have been validated in a general population. In a general population, classification algorithms (classifiers) must not only discern type 1 diabetes (T1D) from T2D, but also identify diabetes while accounting for events that might lead to inclusion of non-cases, such as use of GLD in the treatment of other conditions. Currently, no type-specific diabetes classifier has been validated in a general population, which leaves register-based studies in this area vulnerable to biases.\n\n\n1.5.4 Register-based diabetes classifiers\nIn Denmark, the first resource readily available to researchers to identify diabetes cases using register data was the National Diabetes Register, established in 2006. The National Diabetes Register was discontinued in 2012, and a later validation study questioned its validity and called for future registers to adopt inclusion based on elevated HbA1c levels.\nLaunched in 2014, the Register of Selected Chronic Diseases (RSCD) is currently the only publicly available resource to identify diabetes cases in Danish register data (by application to the Danish Health Data Authority), but it has not been publicly validated nor is the source code behind the algorithm publicly available. Notably, the algorithm lacks inclusion based on elevated HbA1c levels.\nSince the launch of RSCD, nationwide laboratory data on HbA1c testing has become available in the Danish register ecosystem,22 but have yet to be incorporated into available diabetes classifiers."

    "text": "1.6 Introduction at a glance\nT2D is a disease that carries serious risks, but several treatment options are available to control the risk factors in T2D and reduce the risk of complications and death. In an aging population, the burden of T2D on healthcare services is rising, and resources must be prioritized to those with higher needs to ensure adequate care.\nMigrants are particularly vulnerable to T2D, having an increased prevalence of the disease compared to native Danes. Despite having higher HbA1c levels than their native counterparts, evidence on complication risk and mortality in migrants is inconsistent, but some evidence suggests a higher risk. Evidence on disparities in care that may contribute excess risk in migrants with T2D is limited, and research in this area faces several challenges that may explain this, such as limited sample sizes and migrants being hard-to-reach for intervention and survey studies. Register-based studies are well-suited to handle these limitations, but currently there is no validated method to identify T2D cases in a general population, which leaves register-based studies in this area vulnerable to biases.\nIn Denmark, guidelines are available to direct clinicians and patients towards the best possible outcomes while prioritizing resources. Despite the special challenges facing migrants, current guidelines do not contain specific recommendations for T2D care in migrants, perhaps due to the limited evidence on specific areas of T2D care where disparities between migrant groups and native Danes may be present.\n\n\n\n\n1.

Private actors include GPs and other specialist practices (e.g. ophthalmologists), as well as other healthcare professionals (e.g. podiatrists). In addition, the 98 Danish municipalities are obliged to offer resources to prevent and/or manage chronic disease, such as programs on managing T2D through diet and physical exercise.\nAlthough referral to outpatient hospital care is possible, patients with T2D are primarily treated at the GP, which native Danes and migrants with residence permit have free access to. In the tax-funded Danish public healthcare system, Danish citizens and migrants with residence permit have equal access to services, and nearly all services are provided free of charge, although T2D patients incur some out-of-pocket co-payments for podiatrist care and prescription drug purchases at pharmacies. Yearly co-payments towards medication expenditures are partially covered from €132 and expenditures beyond €553 are fully covered (2019 limits),1 while 50% of all expenditures towards diabetes-specific podiatrist care are covered by the the public health insurance.2"

    "text": "3.2 Register data sources\nIn Denmark, civil registration, public healthcare contacts, and drug prescriptions are recorded with a unique personal identifier (the CPR number) given to all Danish residents at immigration or birth. This enables coverage of the entire population and complete linkage between data sources, and forms the foundation of several nationwide Danish healthcare registers.3 The following section briefly describes the data extracted from these registers, as well as other data sources used in the PhD project. A detailed list of variables and code values used is available in Supplementary material A.\n\n3.2.1 The Danish Civil Registration System\nThe Danish Civil Registration System contains civil registration data on all residents in Denmark. Information on migrations and country of origin was extracted, in addition to data on age, sex, equivalised disposable household income,4 employment status, and region of residence.\n\n\n3.2.2 The Danish National Patient Register\nThe Danish National Patient Register contains information on all hospital admissions and outpatient contacts. Data on diagnoses of diabetes and cardiovascular complications, and procedures relating to retinal screening and treatment of cardiovascular complications was extracted from 1994 through 2018. At the time of this PhD project, the clinical coding system in use was the International Classification of Diseases, \\(10th\\) revision (ICD-10), implemented in 1994.5\n\n\n3.2.3 The Danish National Health Service Register\nThe Danish National Health Service Register contains information on all public healthcare services provided in the primary care sector. The data is essentially billing information, and serves as the basis for payment to the healthcare provider from the Danish regions. Each type of service has a unique SPECIALE-code (e.g. all diabetes-specific podiatrist care services are contained as sub-codes under SPECIALE-code 54) Information on diabetes-specific services performed at podiatrist and ophthalmologist practices from 1990 through 2018 was extracted, as well as point-of-care HbA1c testing performed at GPs.\n\n\n3.2.4 The Danish National Prescription Registry\nThe Danish National Prescription Registry contains information on all prescription drug purchases at Danish pharmacies, classified according to the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) Classification. These registrations serve to determine reimbursement awarded to each purchase from the public health insurance. Information on purchases of GLD, LLD, ACEI, ARB, and APT from 1995 through 2018 was extracted.\n\n\n3.2.5 The Danish Register of Laboratory Results for Research\nThe Danish Register of Laboratory Results for Research contains information on clinical biomarker samples analysed at clinical biochemistry departments in hospitals around Denmark. With the exception of point-of-care tests, all biomarker samples taken in the primary healthcare sector are sent for analysis in hospital laboratories. Compared to the other registers, this is a relatively new data source, initially launched in 2013, and only recently achieved nationwide coverage.6\nAt the time of data extraction, the Central Denmark Region, one of five administrative regions in Denmark (population of 1.3 million inhabitants, 22% of the entire Danish population) was not yet covered in the register. To address this issue, laboratory results from this part of the the population were extracted directly from the Clinical Laboratory Information System, a clinical database that stores all laboratory results analysed in Central Denmark Region. Data on HbA1c, LDL-C, and UACR analyses were extracted from 2011 through 2018."

    "text": "3.3 Diabetes classification algorithms\nAs described previously in Section 1.5.4, currently available register-based diabetes classifiers have yet to incorporate the emerging register data on routine HbA1c testing, despite recommendations to do so. Wishing to take advantage of this data, we developed a new classifier, the OSDC. As a point of reference, we developed an implementation of the RSCD diabetes classifier (version 1.0, August 2016) according to official documentation.7\nThe following sections describe the algorithms behind these diabetes classifiers. Pros and cons of their design are discussed in Chapter 5.\n\n3.3.1 The Open-Source Diabetes Classifier\nThis classifier first identifies a population of individuals with any type of diabetes mellitus, and then splits this population into T1D and T2D by identifying individuals with T1D and classifying the remainder of the diabetes population as T2D.\nIn OSDC, diabetes is defined at the second occurrence of any event across the four types of inclusion events listed below. All available data is used, except purchases of GLD, which are restricted to data from 1997 onwards.\n\nHbA1c measurements of ≥48 mmol/mol, after censoring:\n\nResults of samples taken during pregnancies - potential gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM).\n\nHospital diagnoses of diabetes.\nDiabetes-specific services received at podiatrist.\nPurchases of GLD after censoring:\n\nBrand drugs for weight loss, e.g. Saxenda.\nPurchases during pregnancies - potential treatment of GDM.\nMetformin purchases in women below age 40 - potential treatment of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).\n\n\nDiabetes type is classified as either T1D or T2D based on patterns of purchases of insulins (including analogues) and hospital primary diagnoses of T1D and T2D. Classification as T1D requires an individual to fulfill either of the following criteria:\n\nMust have purchased only insulins and never any other type of GLD, and have at least one diagnosis of T1D\nMust have a majority of T1D diagnoses from endocrinological departments (or from other medical departments, in the absence of contacts to endocrinological departments), and a purchase of insulin within 180 days after onset of diabetes, with insulin contributing at least two thirds of all defined daily doses of GLD purchased.8\n\nIn populations generated on a fixed index date (such as the cross-sectional studies associated with this dissertation), individuals classified as T1D must have purchased insulins in the last year prior to the index date.\nIndividuals not classified as T1D are classified as T2D.\n\n\n3.3.2 The Register of Selected Chronic Diseases\nFormally, the RSCD includes two separate algorithms, RSCD-T1D and RSCD-T2D, that identify T1D and T2D, respectively. In practice, however, they are inter-dependent, as individuals identified by the T2D classifier are excluded from the T1D classifier.\nIn RSCD, diabetes is defined by type-specific diagnoses of T1D or T2D, and purchases of GLD. Individuals are defined as having T1D or T2D if they meet any of the algorithm’s inclusion criteria without fulfilling any of its exclusion criteria.\n\n3.3.2.1 Classification of type 2 diabetes\nFor classification of T2D, inclusion criteria include:\n\nAny purchases of non-insulin GLD.\nA hospital diagnosis of T2D as the most recent type-specific diabetes diagnosis.\n\nExclusions from the T2D population include:\n\nWomen that have only purchased metformin and have any diagnoses of PCOS, purchases of clomifene or combination drugs containing antiandrogens and estrogens.\nIndividuals with only one recorded inclusion event.\nIndividuals with no recorded inclusion events in the last 10 years prior to the index date.\n\n\n\n3.3.2.2 Classification of type 1 diabetes\nFor classification of T1D, inclusion criteria include:\n\nAny purchases of insulins.\nA hospital diagnosis of T1D as the most recent type-specific diabetes diagnosis.\n\nExclusions from the T1D population include:\n\nWomen with any diagnoses of GDM, who have made purchases of GLD only in the period between 280 days prior to their first diagnosis of GDM and 280 days after their last diagnosis of GDM.\nIndividuals classified as T2D.\nIndividuals without any purchases of GLD, or have made only one purchase and have no hospital records of T1D.\nIndividuals with no insulin purchases in the last 10 years prior to the index date."

The survey was conducted in 2020 on all inhabitants aged 18 to 74 years identified as prevalent diabetes cases by OSDC on 31 Dec 2018, plus an equally-sized group of OSDC non-diabetes cases (matched to diabetes cases by sex, age, and municipality). The survey collected self-reported data related to health in general, with an additional focus on items related to diabetes mellitus, such as current disease, diabetes type, and age at onset.In total, 44,659 OSDC diabetes cases and 46,195 matched OSDC non-diabetes cases were invited to the survey, and 51,854 (57%) responded.9\n\n\n3.4.2 The National Health Survey\nThe National Health Survey is a repeated digital and postal questionnaire survey conducted among a representative sample of Danish residents aged 16 or above. It collects self-reported data related to mental and physical health in general, such as current or former chronic diseases, and includes a question on diabetes of any type.10 In the 2017 survey of Central Denmark Region, 52,000 individuals were invited and 32,400 (62%) responded.

    "text": "3.5 Study design and population\nIn addition to developing a code package for the statistical programming language R containing the source-code behind the diabetes classifiers, three studies were conducted. Study I was designed to examine the validity of register-based definitions of T1D and T2D. After validating the two candidate classifiers, the most accurate classifier - OSDC - was chosen to identify study populations of T2D for use in studies II and III.\n[Overview table of the three studies]\n\n3.5.1 Study populations\n\n3.5.1.1 Study I\nValidation analyses were performed in a subset of respondents in the Health in Central Denmark survey.\nAmong survey respondents, 2,411 were excluded due to missing data on diabetes items. 2,093 individuals with self-reported onset of diabetes after 31 December 2018 were excluded, as diabetes cases onset after the index date would erroneously evaluate to false-negative cases in the register-based classifiers, due to the delay from register-classification on the index date (31 December 2018) until questionnaire responses (November 2020).\nAfter these exclusions, 47,350 individuals remained, but due to survey invites being conditioned on OSDC diabetes status, the survey population was biased towards the OSDC classification and OSDC diabetes prevalence was 43.7% (20,692 individuals). To account for this, we first estimated the OSDC diabetes prevalence to be 9.3% (2,483 individuals) in a random sample of 26,665 individuals from the background population with the same age, sex and municipality distributions as the OSDC non-diabetes cases of respondents. To offset the oversampling of OSDC diabetes cases in the survey, OSDC diabetes cases were randomly subsampled to 2,733 individuals to achieve an unbiased OSDC diabetes prevalence of 9.3% in the final study population of 29,391 individuals.\n\n\n3.5.1.2 Study II\nRegister data was used to identify 262,837 individuals with prevalent T2D on 1 January 2018 (index date) from a background population of 3,864,528 native Danes or first-generation migrants from the selected origin categories aged 25 - 99 years, and residing at least 3 years in Denmark on the index date.\nT2D prevalence was studied in the above population. In order to study T2D care where it was clinically relevant, the analyses of T2D care were performed in a distinct subsets of the population with T2D, as outlined below:\n\nAll analyses of T2D care were performed in a subset of 254,097 individuals with T2D onset at least 6 months prior to the index date in order to allow time for baseline-screening, initiation of pharmacological treatment and subsequent biomarker control to occur in the newly-diagnosed.\n\nMonitoring was evaluated among all these individuals:\n\nMonitoring of HbA1c, LDL-C, nephropathy, retinopathy and foot disease: 254,097 individuals.\n\nBiomarker levels were evaluated in those with at least one measurement prior to the index date:\n\nHbA1c levels: 250,075 individuals.\nLDL-C levels: 248,813 individuals.\n\nEach analysis of pharmacological treatment was limited to individuals with a clear guideline-recommendation for that particular treatment according to complication status or biomarker levels on the index date (excluding individuals not alive and resident in Denmark in the year following the index date and thus unable to purchase medication):\n\nGLD. HbA1c ≥48 mmol/mol at the most recent measurement: 140,208 individuals.\nLLD. Prevalent macrovascular complications or DKD, or age above 40 with LDL-C above 2.5 mmol/L: 128,707 individuals.\nACEI/ARB & APT. Prevalent macrovascular complications or DKD: 77,414 individuals.\n\n\n\n\n\n3.5.1.3 Study III\nRegister data was used to identify 275,525 individuals with prevalent T2D on 1 January 2019 (index date) from a background population of 4,084,564 individuals above age 25. Among individuals with T2D, 269,011 native Danes or first-generation migrants from the selected origin categories residing at least 3 years in Denmark on the index date were included. After exclusion of 5,518 individuals without records of HbA1c or LDL-cholesterol, the study population contained 263,393 individuals. A subsequent analysis of GLD use in the year 2021 was performed on 241,140 individuals from the above study population still alive and residing in Denmark on 1 January 2021.\n\n\n\n3.5.2 Outcomes\n\n3.5.2.1 Study I\nThe validation golden standard, self-reported diabetes type, was categorized as either T1D (self-reported T1D), T2D (all other types of diabetes) or no diabetes, corresponding to the diabetes types discernable by the register-based classifiers.\n\n\n3.5.2.2 Study II\nTwelve outcomes were defined as follows\n\nPrevalent T2D was defined as OSDC-classified T2D prevalent on the index date.\n\nT2D care quality was evaluated in the scope of failure to meet guideline recommendations in terms of monitoring (allowing for three months of leeway), biomarker levels, and pharmacological treatment.\nT2D monitoring was evaluated in time-frames prior to index date, according to guideline-recommendations:\n\nMonitoring of HbA1c and LDL-C, as well as UACR-screening for diabetic nephropathy were identified by records of biomarker samples between October 1, 2016 and December 31, 2017 in the Register of Laboratory Results for Research or the Clinical Laboratory Information System. Additional monitoring of HbA1c using point-of-care tests was identified by records in the National Health Service Register.\nScreening for diabetic retinopathy was identified by records of retinal photoscreening for diabetic retinopathy between October 1, 2015 and December 31, 2017 - either at hospital departments in the National Patient Register, or diabetes-specific examinations at ophthalmologist practice recorded in the National Health Service Register .\nScreening for diabetic foot disease was identified by records of diabetes-specific podiatrist services received between October 1, 2016 and December 31, 2017 in the National Health Service Register.\n\nBiomarker levels on the index date was evaluated using the most recent measurement of HbA1c and LDL-C before the index date:\n\nThe outcome measure for HbA1c control was a level ≥53 mmol/mol.\nFor LDL-C, the outcome measure was a level ≥2.6 mmol/L.\n\nPharmacological treatment was assessed in the year following the index date, and treatment was defined by at least one purchase of the respective type of drug based on the following ATC codes (including subcodes):\n\nGLD: ATC A10.\nLLD: ATC C10.\nACEI/ARB: ATC C09A-C09D.\nAPT: ATC B01AC.\n\n\n\n3.5.2.3 Study III\nUse of individual GLD types was defined by any purchases made during the respective year (2019 and 2021). Purchase of the following types of GLD counted towards the total number of drugs used by an individual in a year (fixed-dose combination drugs counting towards both of their component drug types):\n\nMetformin: A10BA02, A10BD0, A10BD10-16, A10BD20, A10BD23.\nSulfonylureas: A10BB.\nDPP4i: A10BH, A10BD0, A10BD10-11, A10BD13, A10BD19, A10BD21, A10BD24.\nSGLT2i: A10BK, A10BD15-24, A10BX09, A10BX11-12.\nInsulins (including analogues): A10A.\nGLP1RA: A10BJ, A10AE5, A10BX04, A10BX07, A10BX10, A10BX13-14.\nThiazolidinediones: A10BG.\nRepaglinide: A10BX02.\n\nSeparate outcomes for the use of each individual GLD type were defined for metformin, sulfonylurea, DPP4i, SGLT2i, insulins, and GLP1RA. In addition, combination therapy was analysed using the following two outcome definitions:\n\nAny combination therapy: two or more drug types purchased in the year\nTriple combination therapy: three or more drug types purchased in the year.\n\n\n\n\n3.5.3 Primary variable of interest: migrant status\nMigrant status and country of origin was defined according to the definitions by Statistics Denmark. Based on the national origins with the most T2D cases and the United Nations M49 geoscheme, the population was grouped into nine origin categories:\n\nNative Danes\nEurope (M49: Europe, except countries of the former Yugoslavia)\nMiddle East (M49: Northern Africa, Western Asia except Turkey, plus Afghanistan and Iran)\n\nAnd the six remaining individual countries with the most T2D cases (in order of number of cases):\n\nTurkey\nFormer Yugoslavia\nPakistan\nSri Lanka\nSomalia\nVietnam\n\n\n\n3.5.4 Other explanatory variables\n\n3.5.4.1 Socioeconomic variables\nAge and diabetes-duration on index dates were treated as continuous variables. Household income was based on the 3-year average of equivalised disposable household income prior to index dates, converted to the corresponding percentile in the background population and treated as a continuous variable. As a measure of acculturation, duration of residence was calculated from the date of first migration into Denmark, converted to a categorical variable with native Danes categorized in the maximally acculturated group. Employment status was categorized as Employed (including students and others), Retired or Unemployed based on the year prior to index dates.\n\n\n3.5.4.2 Clinical variables\nPrevalent macrovascular complications were assessed by primary diagnosis codes of stroke, ischemic heart disease and peripheral arterial disease (and associated procedure codes) prior to index dates. Diabetic kidney disease was defined as a UACR ≥300 mg/g measured within three years prior to index dates (study II: within 27 months). Other types of microvascular complications were not included due to insufficient data.\nStudy III used HbA1c levels and LDL-C levels at baseline as continuous covariates for adjustment, as well as LLD use within a year prior to the index date. Finally, analyses of the use of individual GLD drug types in study III adjusted for combination therapy categorized as Monotherapy or no GLD, Dual combination and Triple combination or more."

    "text": "3.6 Statistical analysis\nStatistical analyses were performed in RStudio11 using R version 412 and a range of open-source code packages for computations13–17 and visualisation.18,19\nThis section describes our overall statistical analysis strategy, followed by the specific statistical analyses of each study.\nLogistic regression - a statistical model that computes odds ratios (OR) between groups - is often applied in cross-sectional studies to estimate relative risk (RR, or risk ratio). However, odds ratios approximate relative risk only when the outcome is rare. If this is not the case, interpreting ORs as RRs will exaggerate risk estimates,20 as illustrated in Figure 3.1 (adapted from D Wells - CC-BY-SA).\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.1: Relationship between odds ratio and relative risk depending on baseline risk.\n\n\n\n\nNone of the outcomes in studies II & III were expected to be rare, and thus logistic regression was unsuitable. While log-binomial regression models are the most natural choice for computing relative risk in a mathematical sense, they are prone to convergence failure.21 Given the large number of outcomes and models that needed fitting, this presented a serious (although not insurmountable) inconvenience, and log-binomial regression was also discarded.\nRobust Poisson regression (sometimes termed modified Poisson regression)22 presented an appealing alternative for modeling RR. A comprehensive description of the technique is beyond the scope of this dissertation, but a brief explanation is in order, since ordinary Poisson regression is not the right tool for modeling binary outcomes as such data violate the assumptions behind the model.23 When applied to binomial data, the error for the estimated relative risk will be overestimated in an ordinary Poisson model. However, this problem can be addressed by using robust generalized estimating equations (so-called sandwich) variance estimates, which provide accurate standard errors in the presence of over-dispersion and excess zeros,24 such as in a binary distribution. Ultimately, this allows robust Poisson regression to estimate RR with valid confidence intervals in data with binary outcomes.25\nAll regression models were modeled with native Danes as the reference group. To account for potential non-linearity, continuous variables were modeled as natural splines with knots placed at each quintile of the distribution in the respective study population. Supplementary analyses where continuous variable were modeled as categorical variables (quintiles) were conducted for easier interpretation of these variables. Supplementary analyses also included estimates of absolute risk differences corresponding to the above analyses. In these analyses, a generalized linear model using a Gaussian distribution and identity link with robust sandwich variance estimates was used to compute absolute risk difference with 95% confidence intervals.\nIn all three studies, the characteristics of study populations were presented, describing continuous variables with means and standard differences, and categorical variables by absolute numbers and percentage proportions. In study I, characteristics were tabulated according to self-reported, OSDC-classified, and RSCD-classified diabetes type, while study II and III tabulated the distribution of covariates and outcomes by origin group.\nThe following sections describes the statistical analyses of each study.\n\n3.6.0.1 Study I\nValidation analyses were performed separately for T1D and T2D, where each register-based diabetes classifier was validated against self-reported diabetes type. Within analyses of each diabetes type, diabetes type was modeled as a distinct binary variable: does the individual have this diabetes type or not (e.g. in the analyses of T1D, diabetes type was modeled as a binary variable of T1D vs. no T1D, the latter category including both T2D and non-diabetes cases).\nConcordance tables and associated validation metrics were computed (with 95% confidence intervals) as defined in equations 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4: sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV). These validation analyses were bootstrapped in 1000 random subsamples in order to assess robustness.\n\\[ Sensitivity = \\frac{N_{true positives}}{N_{true positives}+N_{false negatives}} \\tag{3.1}\\]\n\\[ Specificity = \\frac{N_{true negatives}}{N_{true negatives}+N_{false positives}} \\tag{3.2}\\]\n\\[ PPV = \\frac{N_{true positives}}{N_{true positives}+N_{false positives}} \\tag{3.3}\\]\n\\[ NPV = \\frac{N_{true negatives}}{N_{true negatives}+N_{false negatives}} \\tag{3.4}\\]\nFurthermore, analyses stratified by self-reported age at onset of diabetes (including all self-reported non-diabetes cases in both strata of age at onset) were performed to assess the influence of age at onset of diabetes on sensitivity and PPV.\n\n\n3.6.0.2 Study II\nRobust Poisson regression was used to compute RR and 95% confidence intervals in a series of cross-sectional analyses of T2D prevalence and eleven outcomes within T2D care.\nIn the analysis of T2D prevalence, RR of prevalent T2D was computed in a crude model and in two models with different levels of adjustment to explore the effects of clinical (model 1) and socioeconomic factors (model 2) on migrant risks. The first model adjusted for sex and age (model 1); the second model further adjusted for employment status, household income, duration of residence, and region of residence (model 2). Additionally, age-specific T2D prevalence in each migrant group was modeled using a binomial model with log-link and restricted cubic splines as a function of age.\nIn the eleven analyses of T2D care, the RR of not receiving each type of guideline-level T2D care was computed in a crude model and in two adjusted models to visualize risk disparities in a clinical context separately from the fully-adjusted model. The first model (model 1) adjusted for clinical risk factors in diabetes that may influence decision-making when planning diabetes care with the patient (sex, age, diabetes duration, prevalent macrovascular complications and DKD). The fully-adjusted model (model 2) further adjusted for socioeconomic factors that may influence a patient’s health behavior and healthcare service usage (employment status, household income, duration of residence, and region of residence).\nIn order to assess potential disparities at other cut-off values of HbA1c and LDL-C, cumulative empirical distributions were plotted with 95% confidence intervals computed with Kolmogorov-Smirnov’s D.\n\n\n3.6.0.3 Study III\nSimilar to study II, robust Poisson regression was used to compute RR with 95% confidence intervals in three models for each outcome: an unadjusted model (crude), a model adjusted for clinical risk factors (model 1), and a model adjusted for clinical and socioeconomic factors (model 2). Compared to the models in study II, all adjusted models in this study contained adjustment for additional clinical risk factors (HbA1c level, LDL-C level, and lipid-lowering drug usage), and the analyses of individual GLD type also including adjustment for the degree of combination therapy."
