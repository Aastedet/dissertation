This is a Quarto website for my PhD dissertation. Note that the dissertation is currently a work in progress and is nowhere near ready for submission, let alone approval by the assessment committee. The content is currently a mix of placeholders and is subject to change.

The dissertation is built on a template adapted from the [quartothesis skeleton](https://github.com/biostats-r/quartothesis) originally created by Richard Telford at the Department of Biological Sciences, University of Bergen.

You can view the rendered website [here](https://aastedet.github.io/dissertation/) and download the pdf version [here](https://aastedet.github.io/dissertation/Type-2-diabetes-in-migrants--register-based-analyses.pdf)
