This is a Quarto website for my PhD dissertation entitled "Type 2 diabetes in migrants: a register-based analysis". The website contains my PhD dissertation, but Quarto book also generates the dissertation in pdf format, which is required for submission to the graduate school. In terms of core content, it is identical to the pdf-file submitted to the graduate school, although the individual articles have been omitted from the website, as they are all open-access publications. Links to the papers are provided [here](https://aastedet.github.io/dissertation/0-papers.html) as soon as they are published.

Both the submitted dissertation and this website were made with [QuartoÂ®](https://quarto.org/), an open-source scientific and technical publishing system, with inspiration from the [quartothesis skeleton](https://github.com/biostats-r/quartothesis) by professor Richard Telford of the Department of Biological Sciences, University of Bergen.

The rendered pdf-file can be found [here](https://aastedet.github.io/dissertation/Type-2-diabetes-in-migrants--a-register-based-analysis.pdf).
