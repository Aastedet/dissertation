## Notes on website version {.unnumbered .unlisted}

This website contains my PhD dissertation in html form. In terms of content, it is practically identical to the pdf-file submitted to the graduate school - both were made with [QuartoÂ®](https://quarto.org/), an open-source scientific and technical publishing system. The rendered pdf-file can be found [here](https://aastedet.github.io/dissertation/Type-2-diabetes-in-migrants--register-based-analyses.pdf).
