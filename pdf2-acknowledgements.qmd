# Acknowledgements {.unnumbered}

Lots of nostalgia and thank yous to a lot of people, not least Gregers and the SDCC epi group. Also thanks to the R-foundation, RStudio/Posit, open-source package developers and the R biostatistics group at University of Bergen for providing a Quarto template for this dissertation.

Also thanks to family, friends & colleagues at the Department of Public Health and the Research Unit for General Practice being nice. Thanks to supervisors for discovering when I didn't know what I was doing and for being patient, supportive and insightful throughout.

Thank you to fellow researchers at Steno Diabetes Center Aarhus for great discussions about diabetes, tools and methodology.

Also a special thanks to Luke Johnston, for inspiring me to strive for openness and better programming practices, and thank you to fellow teachers and contributors to the *R for Reproducible Research* courses. I hope my work honors the spirit of open science.
