## Key main findings

This dissertation identified several important findings in the three associated studies.
In study I, we determined whether register-based classifiers can identify valid populations of T1D and T2D in a general Danish population. Then we investigated disparities in T2D care between migrants and native Danes in two cross-sectional studies. Study II analysed T2D prevalence and disparity in care quality as outlined in guideline recommendations for monitoring, biomarker levels, and pharmacological treatment, while study III explored disparities in GLD treatment in terms of combination therapy and types of GLD used.

In this chapter, the main findings of each study are discussed separately in light of existing literature. In addition, clinical considerations raised by studies II and III are discussed in the last section. Risk factors in T2D care beyond migrant origin are not the focus of this dissertation and are not presented or discussed in detail. However, these risk factors are of great importance in a broader scope of equity in T2D care provision, and interested readers should visit the online appendix, where risk estimates for all covariables are available. 

## Study I

In this study, we validated two predefined algorithms (OSDC and RSCD) classifying diabetes type in Danish register data against self-reported diabetes type in a Danish survey population. Overall, both classifiers performed excellent in terms of PPV in both T1D and T2D, as well as sensitivity in T2D classification (all estimates 0.875 and above), and had near-perfect accuracy in terms of specificity and NPV in both T1D and T2D (all estimates 0.989 and above). Both classifiers were unable to accurately classify diabetes type in individuals with T1D onset after age 40 and T2D onset before age 40.

Sensitivity & NPV were higher in OSDC than in RSCD for both diabetes types. In T1D classification, these differences are attributable to differences in the algorithms, as both algorithms relied on the same data sources for identifying T1D (GLD use and type-specific diabetes diagnoses).27 In T2D, this difference may be explained by the use of HbA1c data in OSDC, which enables inclusion of diabetes cases at the time of diagnosis, rather than requiring subsequent initiation of GLD treatment or hospitalization. Specificity and PPV in T2D classification was higher in RSCD than in OSCD, possibly explained by inclusion of milder cases in the latter, who may be less likely to correctly report having diabetes, e.g. if an individual had never purchased GLD or been hospitalized in relation to the disease. Notably, the demographics of the register-classified diabetes populations differed, particularly in T1D, where OSDC’s higher sensitivity in women (0.846 vs. 0.725, supplementary analyses in online appendix) resulted in a higher prevalence of women in the OSDC population compared to RSCD. This is in line with a previous study comparing the Danish National Diabetes Register (which did not use HbA1c) against a local database containing HbA1c as an alternative inclusion criterion, which found higher prevalences of diabetes in the HbA1c-augmented definition, especially among women.

To the best of our knowledge, this study was the first to validate performance of a type-specific diabetes classifier in a general population setting of individuals with and without diabetes. Other studies have validated type-specific diabetes classifier performance in populations consisting only of individuals with diabetes, which fails to test the algorithm’s ability to discern individuals with diabetes from those without, and overestimates the accuracy of the algorithm compared to its performance in a general population. In addition, both algorithms were pre-specified, as opposed to the data-driven, exploratory approaches used in other validation studies to design algorithms optimized for a particular dataset, which risks overfitting and overestimation of performance compared to a general population.8,11,12 Despite these differences, the performance of both classifiers in our study was superior to the T1D-classification accuracy previously reported by studies in the United States and Hong Kong,8,13 comparable to those reported in the United Kingdom,14 but inferior to that reported by a study in Canada.12

The poor performance of the register-based classifiers in subgroups with diabetes onset at atypical age is likely to reflect clinical uncertainty in these cases resulting in inaccurate type-specific diabetes diagnoses and uncharacteristic GLD purchase patterns35, which may lead the algorithms to misclassify. Sensitivity in T1D-classification has previously been reported to be highly age at onset-dependent,11 and our findings indicate that this issue also extends to PPV and to T2D classification.

## Study II

In this study, prevalence of T2D and disparities
between migrant groups and native Danes were analysed across eleven indicators of
guideline-recommendations on monitoring, biomarker levels and
pharmacological treatment.

We found that the prevalence of T2D was higher in migrants compared to
native Danes, especially in migrants from Sri Lanka and Pakistan, who
were four to five times more likely to have T2D compared to native
Danes. While similar findings have previously been reported in Denmark
[@andersen2016; @Kristensen2007] and across Europe,[@meeks2016] our study shows this risk
persisting after adjusting for differences in socioeconomic position.

Failure to fulfill guideline recommendations and targets for T2D care was common, as
the proportion of native Danes unable to fulfill recommendations was below
10\% in only two indicators (HbA1c-monitoring and GLD-treatment), and
above 25\% in eight (all other indicators except monitoring of LDL-C).
Non-fulfillment of guideline recommendations was more common in migrants, particularly in terms of monitoring and control of HbA1c and LDL-C levels. In the majority of these
indicators, we observed increased crude risks at a significance level of
$\alpha = 0.05$ in most migrant groups, while no clear overall pattern across migrant groups was observed in the indicators of pharmacological treatment.

Migrants from Somalia stood out across the all aspects of T2D care, having increased crude risk in all eleven indicators, and the highest risk of
all migrants in nine. Disparity between migrants and native Danes was
largest in the indicators of glycemic control and screening for diabetic
foot disease, where crude risk was increased by more than one-third in
most migrant groups, and in the indicator of lipid control, where
migrants from Somalia had almost twice the risk of native Danes.

Our findings of lower likelihood of T2D monitoring in most migrant
groups contrast findings from prior studies, where migrants received
similar or more monitoring compared to native Danes,[@Kristensen2007] 
Norwegians,[@Tran2010] and Swedes,[@Rawshani2015] but is in line with recent findings of less timely monitoring in ethnic minority groups in England.[@Whyte2019] The proportion of the T2D population without timely monitoring varied substantially
between each type of monitoring, but socioeconomic factors such as household
income and region of residence were risk factors in all types of
monitoring. Screening for diabetic foot disease is the only service
where patient expenditures are not fully covered by the public health
insurance, which may explain why it was the indicator with the highest
proportion of individuals without timely monitoring. In addition, the large disparity
between migrants and native Danes in this indicator, which persisted
after adjusting for socioeconomic variables, suggests that economic
barriers may disproportionately limit access to care in migrant groups.

In line with previous studies, most migrant groups were less likely than
native Danes to achieve glycemic control.[@Tran2010; @Negandhi2013, @Rawshani2015; @Whyte2019] The magnitude of the
risk was similar to what has been reported in previous studies, although
it may seem lower when compared to estimates reported as odds ratios
(OR) in other studies, since OR lead to exaggerated risk estimates if
interpreted as RR when the outcome is common;[@holcomb2001] e.g. a study in
Scotland reported a crude OR of dysglycemia of 2.2 in the Pakistani
group, and a dysglycemia-prevalence of roughly 50\% in the reference
group,[@Negandhi2013] which corresponds to a RR of 1.4,[@Grant2014] similar to our
estimate.

To the best of our knowledge, increased LDL-C levels among migrants have not been reported in the few previous studies,[@Eastwood2021] although a small US study noted a small trend toward higher lipid levels in migrants from Somalia.[@Wieland2012] Several studies have examined obesity in migrants from Somalia and found high prevalences of obesity and increased waist-to-hip ratio in women, but not in
men. [@Gele2013; @Skogberg2018; @Ahmed2018] If this pattern between sexes extends to migrants from Somalia in Denmark, it seems unlikely that anthropometric factors alone
explain the very high levels of LDL-C in this population, as the risk
remained unchanged in analyses stratified by sex (supplementary analyses in online appendix).

Most studies of pharmacological treatment in T2D have analysed the whole
population, rather than subgroups with a clinical indication for
treatment, and have evaluated incident medication use in the
newly-diagnosed, making direct comparisons to our findings difficult.
The finding of lower or similar risk of GLD non-use in most migrant
groups is in line with previous studies comparing migrants to native
populations, [@Tran2010; @Rawshani2015], while the lower risk of LLD non-use in most migrant groups contrasts findings from prior studies.[@RamirezSanchez2013; @Tran2010; @Eastwood2021] The increased risk of dysglycemia in the Somalia-group coincided with an
increased risk of not receiving GLD, and this pattern was also observed
for dyslipidemia and LLD in the Somalia and Europe groups, indicating a
particular need to increase uptake of pharmacological treatment in these
groups.
Similar to a study from Italy, we found a higher risk of not receiving ACEI/ARB treatment in most migrant groups, but contrary to that study, the risk of not receiving APT was similar in most groups in our study.[@Marzona2018] As the indications for treatment with ACEI/ARB and APT were identical in our study, one might expect similar risk patterns in these outcomes, but
this was not the case, perhaps due to unmeasured differences between the groups in terms of indications, counter-indications,
awareness and attitude to these drugs.

Some of the disparities between migrants and native Danes could be
attributed to a much higher prevalence of risk factors of poor T2D care
in migrants; specifically young age, low household income and residence
in the Capital Region.

## Study III

In this study, we explored disparities in GLD treatment in terms of combination therapy and types of GLD used. In a sense, this study expands on the analysis of pharmacological treatment with GLD performed in study II, which was a simple evaluation of GLD treatment being present or not. The analysis of GLD in study II found no overall pattern of disparity across migrant groups, but did not capture any nuances in the treatment provided, which is what we explored next in study III. In this study, we found that most migrant groups were less likely to receive combination GLD therapy than native Danes. We also found that, compared to native Danes, most migrant groups were more likely to receive oral GLD types (metformin, sulfonylureas, DPP4i, and SGLT2i), but less likely to receive injection-based GLD types (insulins and GLP1RA). Disparity was largest in GLP1RA use, where RR ranged from 0.30-0.60 in all migrant groups, excluding the Europe-group.

As in study II, migrants from Somalia stood out, having the lowest likelihood of receiving combination therapy and GLP1RA of all groups.

To the best of our knowledge, combination therapy usage has not previously been studied in migrants, but disparities between racial groups have been examined, and these proxies of ethnicity provide a basis for comparisons. With the notable exception of migrants in the four smallest migrant groups (Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Somalia and Vietnam), migrants in our study received combination therapy on a level close to native Danes after adjustments (RRs around 0.95 to 1.05). Since combination therapy is not a hard clinical endpoint, we argue that the modest disparities observed in most migrants were insignificant from a clinical perspective. At a glance, this may contrast another UK study reporting a high odds ratio of experiencing inertia in initiation of combination therapy in non-white groups compared to whites (e.g. odds ratio in Blacks: 1.43), and reporting their findings as persuasive evidence of disparities[9]. However, the high prevalence of inertia in the reference group (67.1%) of the study exaggerates this risk estimate if interpreted as RR, and the corresponding RR (around 1.11 for Blacks)[38] is more in line with our findings.

The higher prevalence of metformin, sulfonylurea and DPP4i in migrant groups is in line with previous reports in non-white minorities[22, 24]. The particularly high prevalence of sulfonylureas in migrants from Vietnam may reflect care being influenced by practice in the origin country, as sulfonylureas are widely-used in Vietnam, where it is used in roughly three-quarters of all T2D patients [40]. By contrast, the higher prevalence of SGLT2 found in our study contradicts previous studies on racial minorities [24, 27, 29].
The very low prevalence of GLP1RA use in migrants compared to the native population has not previously been reported, but is in line with previous reports of disparities in non-white minorities[22, 24, 27]. Similarly, the low prevalence of insulin treatment in migrants with T2D is in line with an Italian study[10] and studies on non-white minorities elsewhere[22, 41].

We only had access to non-medication data prior to 2019, and since GLD treatment practice changed considerably in the subsequent years (even before the broadening of GLP1RA/SGLT2i-recommendations in 2022), our findings may not persist in the new clinical context. However, supplementary analyses of GLD use in 2021 found that, despite substantial changes to GLD use compared to 2019 – including >50% increases in GLP1RA and SGLT2i user-prevalences – disparities between migrants and native Danes remained unchanged, indicating that our findings are robust rather than limited to a clinical setting of narrow indication or low prevalence of use of these drugs.

## Clinical implications

In study II, the evaluation of quality of care using binary process and outcome indicators does not capture qualitative differences in the provided care, nor do they account for
valid patient-specific reasons for not providing care or achieving
biomarker control. In some individuals, failure to achieve biomarker
control may be unrelated to the quality of provided care (e.g.~due to
genetic factors), and a lack of monitoring may not affect risk factors
and the risk of adverse outcomes. In contrast, there is less leeway for the timely provision of pharmacological treatment to patients with a guideline-indication for treatment. Drug side-effects or contra-indications may be valid clinical reasons for a patient not receiving a particular drug, but it is unlikely that these prohibit all treatment options offered by guidelines (e.g. all GLD or LLD types), and based on clinical experience, we assess that this only explains a very small fraction of non-users. Thus, the clinical implications of disparities in pharmacological treatment are clearer and merit further discussion below.

Barriers to pharmacological treatment can stem from the healthcare system, the clinician, and the patient, and efforts to increase use can target any of the three.

Healthcare policies affecting patient-incurred costs are major determinants of pharmacological treatment accessibility[42, 43]. In the Danish universal healthcare system, yearly drug expenditures are partially covered from €132 and expenditures beyond €553 are fully covered (2019 limits). While patients with higher medication expenses will incur similar costs, regardless of the number or types of GLD used, patients treated with fewer, cheaper generic drugs will only receive limited coverage and may perceive costs as a barrier to using newer, more expensive GLD types. In study III there were indications of financial barriers to using the more expensive GLD regimens, as lower household income was associated with less use of triple combination therapy, SGLT2i, and GLP1RA (see supplementary analyses, appendix D). This could indicate that broader coverage of GLD expenditures may serve to increase the use of combination therapy, SGLT2, and GLP1RA in the poorest patient groups, in which migrants constitute a disproportionately large share.

Clinicians may be reluctant to prescribe insulin in migrants if a language barrier is present, given the complex nature of administrations and risk of hypoglycemia. However, the use of GLP1RA does not carry these risks and should not take up more resources of the prescriber (e.g. physician or staff consultation time) over oral GLD, even if language barriers are present. Increasing GP awareness of disparities in pharmacological treatment of migrants with T2D (e.g. by increasing focus on migrants in clinical guidelines) may reduce the risk of suboptimal pharmacological treatment in these groups.

Patient preference of oral administration over injection-based drugs is also likely to influence prescribing. Migrant origin may influence this preference and explain the divergent findings between oral and injection drugs, particularly between GLP1RA and SGLT2i. Studies have reported several reasons for insulin-aversion among migrants, including fears of weight gain, loss of independence, risk of hypoglycemia and death[44-46]. GLP1RA use in migrants may suffer from similar fears due to the administration similarities to insulin injections, and patient education may be able to address these.

The massive disparities faced by migrants from Somalia in all areas of care studied in this PhD project hold particular implications for clinicians (and perhaps also for health planners and local communities). Overall, they indicate that clinicians treating patients from this group should consider prioritizing attention to care quality in this group, particularly in relation to pharmacological treatment with GLDs and LLDs. Specifically, LLDs are available in relatively cheap oral form, and expenditures and patient preference are less likely to be major barriers to use of these drugs. Therefore, increasing awareness among GPs to the high lipid levels and need for LLD treatment in migrants from Somalia with T2D may be a potential approach to increasing treatment quality in this group.
