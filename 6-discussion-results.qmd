# Discussion of results

## Key main findings

Register-based classifiers identified valid populations of T1D and T2D in a general population, but diabetes type in cases with atypical age at onset of diabetes should be interpreted with caution.

Disparities between migrant groups and native Danes, yes, but much can be attributed to differences in clinical characteristics. Largest disparities in podiatrist monitoring, control of HbA1c and LDL-cholesterol and GLP1RA use. Migrants from Somalia received "poorer" care in all outcomes, and poorest care of all groups in most.
