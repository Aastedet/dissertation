## Key main findings

Register-based classifiers identified valid populations of T1D and T2D in a general population, but diabetes type in cases with atypical age at onset of diabetes should be interpreted with caution.

Disparities between migrant groups and native Danes, yes, but much can be attributed to differences in clinical characteristics. Largest disparities in podiatrist monitoring, control of HbA1c and LDL-cholesterol and GLP1RA use. Migrants from Somalia received "poorer" care in all outcomes, and poorest care of all groups in most.

In the following sections, the main findings out each study will be discussed separately in light of existing literature.

### Study I

*\[probably mostly CP from paper?\]*

Comparisons to NDR?

RSCD is implemented ad verbatim from documentation, which may not complete reflect the source code use by the Danish Health Data Authority to generate the register population. We deviated from documentation where we assessed it to be inaccurate, e.g. having no tie-breaker for classifying individuals with equal numbers of T1D-diagnoses and T2D diagnoses who also had a diagnosis of T1D and T2D on the same day as their latest diagnoses. Following documentation to the letter would omit these patients completely from the diabetes population, while our implementation included them as T2D cases.
