The overall aim of this PhD dissertation is to provide robust knowledge on specific areas of T2D care where disparities between migrant groups and native Danes may be present.

## Specific aims

I.  Develop a register-based classification of type 1 and type 2 diabetes and make it available to other researchers.

II. Validate available register-based diabetes classifiers.

III. Assess prevalence of T2D in migrant minorities of Denmark, and explore disparities between migrant groups and native Danes in indicators of guideline-recommendations on monitoring, biomarker control, and pharmacological treatment.

IV. Evaluate disparities in the quality of glucose-lowering pharmacological treatment between migrants and native Danes in terms of combination therapy and drug types.
